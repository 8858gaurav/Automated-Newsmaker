    "Hi everyone this code is useful when we try to find out the count of person name that has been appeared for a particular duration in a different categories. Here we apply a Counter for each articles separtely rather than combining the whole articles at once. earlier we combined all the articles & then we count the person name, but the problem is we don't take care the sir name, that sir name is useless for us. \n",
    "In this first we apply the counter on each articles, then we find out the first/last name that is related to the full name. The first/last name is like a substring to the full name. if substring is matched to the full name then this will be added to the full name. d is an output dictionary from Counter module, and 'X Y' -full name, 'X' - First name, 'Y'- last name in a particular articles.\n",

While dealmaking is bound to slow down by the decision, interest of Chinese investors in the Indian tech space could also take a beating, they said.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince Indian domestic funds mostly restrict themselves to early-stage investments, startups rely on foreign capital for those multi-million dollar cheques. Chinese companies have been one of the most active participants in this market. As per industry figures, up to $4 billion came into India from China as investments in 2019.\\r\\n\\r\\n“This move is expected to dampen interest on both sides, investors from China and companies seeking funding from Chinese companies,” said a partner at a venture capital firm. “This could also slow down funding processes causing further delays.”\\r\\n\\r\\nNormally, for investments in sectors which are regulated in the country, it takes between one and two weeks for government approvals. Given all such investments will need the regulatory nod, the time taken for these clearances will shoot up, in turn delaying the investment process.\\r\\n\\r\\nIndustry insiders remarked that given the tough situation Indian startups are in because of the spread of COVID-19, if they find it difficult to attract Chinese capital, it could spell doom. With Western nations grappling with their own crisis around the pandemic, how many of the investors from those countries will be in a position to make aggressive bets in India is a big question.\\r\\n\\r\\n“If the government wants to regulate flow of capital from China, then they should incentivise Indian institutional investors and corporates to invest in startups and domestic VC funds” said Ntasha Berry, co-founder of Venture Gurukool, which helps Indian startups reach out to Chinese investors.\\r\\n\\r\\nMany Indian unicorns have received massive rounds of funding from large Chinese investors like Tencent, Fosun and Alibaba’s Ant Financial. Paytm, Policybazaar, Oyo, Dream11, Oyo Hotels and Homes, and Udaan have all received funding from such deep-pocketed investors. Now there is uncertainty regarding how much more they can get from their existing investors. Will they be interested to participate in further rounds conducted by these players? That is the big question.\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese VCs disappointed \\r\\n\\r\\nMany Chinese unicorns have also scouted for acquisition and partnership options in India, since there is a certain similarity in consumer cultures between the two countries and India offers a massive market opportunity. Further many business models in India were also built on similar experiences in China, which attracted some investors here. Now, if the government starts looking closely at all investments, some of those players might want to relocate attention to the South East Asian markets, which are more open to Chinese money.\\r\\n\\r\\n“In fact, there is a strong chatter in the Chinese VC ecosystem around their disappointment at the move and how it could lay to waste their efforts in understanding India and how the ecosystem here is developing,” said the partner of a VC firm quoted earlier.\\r\\n\\r\\nChinese investments in India have largely been in the consumer internet space where they have looked for private wealth rather than technology assets. Hence the need to bring all such investments into this purview has baffled experts.\\r\\n\\r\\n“I think there will be greater scrutiny in sectors like pharmaceuticals and infrastructure startups, where the risk of Chinese investors buying stake is more,” said a founder of an early-stage startup. “India is not home to many companies whose IP would be on the radar of the Chinese government.”\\r\\n\\r\\nIndian startups remain hopeful\\r\\n\\r\\nNow the industry awaits the nitty-gritties to be revealed in the amendments to the FEMA guidelines, but a couple of things are clear. First, the government will keep a close check on the amount of capital coming into India from China, and second, while certain investments will be welcome, those in sectors such as media and pharmaceuticals might get rejected.\\r\\n\\r\\n“Given that the fund-raising attempts presently underway by various Indian companies may also be potentially impacted, it is hoped that the government will come out with clarifications, and exclude “non-sensitive” sectors as well as sectors having employment, large cap-ex potential from the ambit of this new policy,” said legal advocates Khaitan and Co. in a note released on April 18..reckoner_bx{ background-color: #F0F0F0; padding: 20px; font: 400 16px/22px 'Noto Serif',arial; border-radius: 5px; margin-bottom: 0px;}.reckoner_bx .rek_title{font: 700 18px/25px 'Fira Sans',arial; color: #0155A0; margin-bottom: 7px; text-transform: uppercase;}.reckoner_bx .btn_reck{border-radius: 20px; background-color: #135B9D; display: inline-block; font: 700 14px/19px 'Noto Serif',arial; padding: 8px 25px; color: #fff !important; text-decoration: none !important;}.reckoner_bx .rek_btnbx{ margin-top: 10px; }.reckoner_bx .bldcls{font-weight: bold;}Moneycontrol Ready ReckonerNow that payment deadlines have been relaxed due to COVID-19, the Moneycontrol Ready Reckoner will help keep your date with insurance premiums, tax-saving investments and EMIs, among others.Download a copy .icn_reck{fill:#fff;}\\r\\n\\r\\nfunction loginSignupPost(id_form){\\r\\n                                var user_id = getCookie(&quot;nnmc&quot;);\\r\\n                                if(user_id!= &quot;&quot; &amp;&amp; user_id != null) {\\r\\n                                                var package_duration = $.trim($(&quot;#mc_pro_37&quot;).attr(&quot;package_duration&quot;));\\r\\n                                                $(&quot;#mc_pro_37&quot;).attr(&quot;action&quot;,&quot;https://payments.moneycontrol.com/payment.php&quot;);\\r\\n                                                $(&quot;#mc_pro_37&quot;).submit();\\r\\n                                } else {\\r\\n                                                $(&quot;#ifval&quot;).val(&quot;490px&quot;);\\r\\n                                                $(&quot;#myframe&quot;).attr(&quot;src&quot;,&quot;https://accounts.moneycontrol.com/mclogin/?d=2&quot;);\\r\\n                                                $(&quot;#LoginModal&quot;).modal();\\r\\n                                }\\r\\n                }\"}, {'headline': 'OYO undertakes initiatives to support asset owners in India', 'url': 'http://prokerala.com/news/articles/a1032119.html', 'section': None, 'body': '\\nNew Delhi, April 20 : Hospitality major OYO on Monday said that it has taken a number of measures to support asset owners across the country.\\nIn a statement, the company said that it is lessening the burden of payments due and accrued, multiple charges have been waived for the month of March onwards, including value-added service charges, \\'Wizard\\' membership accruals among others.\\n\"Under these initiatives, a total of Rs 24 crore discounts has already been offered to over 3,000 OYO partners and continues to impact several others,\" it said.\\nFurther, the company said that thousands of partners who wanted to become a part of OYO Secure, a financial product similar to an online wallet for simplified deal benefits and real-time visibility of their earnings, were offered support in terms of reduced joining amounts as well as a complimentary 30 per cent top-up from OYO for every recharge to the asset owner\\'s OYO Secure wallet.\\n\"Partners whose financials are most affected by Covid-19 have been given steep take rate discounts up to almost 100 per centA waivers to support them throughout this tough time,\" said the statement.\\nOYO has also partnered with multiple lending institutions in India ranging from NBFCs, private sector banks, and new-age fintech companies to identify and facilitate adequate financing for hotel transformation, upgradation, capital expenditure and working capital requirements.\\nOver the past few months, the disbursals under these renovation and up-gradation advances have crossed Rs 160 crore.

Over the weekend (April 18), the department of promotion of industry and internal trade (DPIIT) tweaked rules, making FDI by any entity of a country, which shares land border with India” subject to government approval.The move may impact investments from countries such as Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and Bhutan and more importantly China.Not surprisingly, Beijing is the only country to have responded to the Indian decision, describing it discriminatory. Ji Rong, the spokesperson for the Chinese embassy asked India to “revise discriminatory practices” and “treat investments from different countries equally”.Until now, a non-resident entity or a foreign investor could invest in India, subject to FDI rules, except in sectors/activities which are prohibited. However, countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan could invest only after government approvals and only in select sectors.But the Covid-19 crisis has dramatically transformed the business landscape across the world, with many Indian startups and tech companies seeing their valuations slump.This raised concerns about companies selling off stake at a discount as they scramble to stay afloat in an uncertain economic environment.The influence of Chinese investment in India’s startups have been growing. The statistics are telling.According to a recent study by Gateway House: Indian Council on Global Relations, a foreign policy think-tank, 18 of the 30 Indian unicorns (companies valued at more than $1 billion) have a Chinese investor.“This means that China is embedded in Indian society, the economy, and the technology ecosystem that influences it,” the report said. “Unlike a port or a railway line, these are invisible assets in small sizes – rarely over $100 million – and made by the private sector, which doesn’t cause immediate alarm”.Gateway House has identified over 75 companies, with Chinese investors concentrated in e-commerce, fintech, media/social media, aggregation services and logistics. A majority – more than half – of India’s 30 Indian unicorns (start-ups with valuation of over $1 billion) have a Chinese investor.These include storied names such as PayTM, Oyo, BigBasket, Ola, PolicyBazaar and Delhivery among others.National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has been flagging concerns over Chinese dominance in India’s booming tech space over the last few years, particularly pointing out worrying possibilities of Beijing’s state-funded apparatus controlling startups here through opaque corporate structures.Top government sources told Hindustan Times that the national security planners believed that firewalls were needed as India and China had many outstanding disputes and legacy issues.These primarily related to the unresolved 3,488 kilometre-long boundary dispute apart from Beijing using Islamabad as a proxy to hit at New Delhi on all fronts including keeping Jammu and Kashmir on a permanent boil.Until the spread of Covid-19, Raisina Hill was not warm to the idea of government oversight on Chinese FDI, with a strand of thought dominating that such a move could affect FDI inflows into India. Besides, it was felt that it could unsettle the fragile equilibrium in India-China bilateral relations, sources pointed out.The institutional knowledge of economic affairs, commerce and industry as well as ministry of external affairs relegated such a policy proposal change to the back burner.The Covid-19 outbreak provided an opportunity to Modi 2.0 to operationalize the FDI changes, with the proposal now enjoying bi-partisan support within India’s security and policy brainstrust.The Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Modi cleared the policy on April 17 with total support from Home Minister Amit Shah. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal.That this was an idea whose time had come hit home on February 1, when the government realised that there was hardly any Indian company that was manufacturing either personal protective equipment, ventilators or masks that the whole world is shopping for in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.Concessions to Chinese imports had also virtually pushed manufacturing out of the country including production of the much-needed critical active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).There have also been concerns within the government that its signature “Make in India” initiative, first launched in 2014 to turn India into a manufacturing powerhouse, was being severely impacted by the allowances that had been extended to China.China is India’s largest bilateral merchandise trading partner, but the balance of trade is heavily tilted in favour of Beijing.Total India-China bilateral trade stood at USD 95.7 billion in 2019, with a deficit of USD 58 billion in favour of Beijing.The total Chinese FDI investment as per industry is USD 6.2 billion in India.The latest move is part of a series of steps that the government has taken since the start of this week after Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) said that People’s Bank of China (PBOC) had raised its stake in the home lender from 0.8% to 1.01% in the March quarter through open market purchases.This led many to voice concerns that India’s systemically-important companies could be vulnerable to creeping take over from foreign investors, aided by dropping valuations.

A slew of growth and early-stage companies, too, which were in talks with Chinese investors for new investment rounds, will likely face difficulties, while follow-on rounds from existing backers may become increasingly complex to execute, according to investors, lawyers and startup founders.  “Companies like mine, where they (Chinese investors) already hold a 33% strategic position, are in a tough spot. No one will touch us in this environment,” the founder of a unicorn told ET, requesting anonymity. The latest missive could potentially put future funding rounds on hold or at least take longer to execute, he added.  Chinese investors — both strategic and financial — have pumped in $3.9 billion in 2019, up from $2 billion in 2018, ET reported earlier. In the process, they have emerged as the biggest backers of the country’s fast-growing digital economy, supplanting the United States.  China’s internet giant Alibaba Group and its affiliate Ant Financial, Tencent Holdings and Fosun RZ Capital have poured in several hundred million dollars into a large number of Indian startups, including unicorns such as Paytm, Zomato, Delhivery, BigBasket, PolicyBazaar, Udaan, Oyo Hotels & Homes, Ola and Dream11.  Dream11 officially declined to participate in the story, while Paytm, Big-Basket and Zomato did not respond to emails till press time Sunday.  For now, the startup ecosystem is waiting for detailed notifications under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) and from the Reserve Bank of India, expected in the next two weeks.  “It will spook Chinese investors, even those that are looking to invest in sectors that come under the automatic route, such as e-commerce, fintech, digital services and logistics, which aren’t perceived as sensitive sectors,” Atul Pandey, partner at leading law firm Khaitan & Co, told ET.  According to Pandey, a Chinese investor participating in an upcoming funding round in its existing portfolio companies will also need to get necessary approvals from the government before continuing to chip in money.  India’s FDI policy review is the latest after a number of countries globally, particularly in Europe, issued warnings related to predatory capital investments by Beijing, following their respective markets go into a tailspin at a time of downbeat valuations during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.    75241870 Investors and startup founders sharply criticised the government’s move. “We’re a capital-deficient country. There isn’t enough domestic capital to sustain economic growth. Yet we continue scoring own goals like retrospective taxation, transfer pricing, super-rich surcharge and now FDI approval. We’re not hurting the investors, we’re hurting our economy,” Ritesh Banglani, partner at Stellaris Venture Partners, wrote on microblogging platform Twitter.  Legal experts also said that enforcing the notification would be “close to impossible.”  “The impracticality of making small investments/cheques in startups subject to government approvals is overwhelming. Implementing it is almost next to impossible,” said Santosh Pai, partner at Link Legal India Law Services, which advises a number of leading Chinese investors in India.  Pai pointed to a recent FDI law enacted by China that came into effect in January, which has a reciprocal principle stating that it would take retaliatory action against companies that operate in China but which originate from a country that has discriminated against its investors.  “One can keep searching in every direction, but will keep coming up against these questions, which will hopefully be accounted for in the forthcoming notifications to implement this press note,” Pai said.  Till then, legal representatives of the Chinese investors in India are advising them to close deals over the next two weeks before the anticipated FEMA notification.  They have also begun to evaluate alternative investment structures from the ones in use currently.  “With regard to all transactions that are currently in the pipeline, the advice will be to try and close it before the FEMA notification is issued.

The impact of the policy on Chinese investors is clear\".\\n  * **Violation of WTO \\'s principles:** \"The additional barriers set by Indian side for investors from specific countries violate WTO’s principle of non-discrimination, and go against the general trend of liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment.\"\\n  * **The policy does \"not conform to the consensus of G20 leaders and trade ministers** to realize a free, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, predictable and stable trade and investment environment, and to keep our markets open\"\\n  * **Revise the policy:** \"We hope India would revise relevant discriminatory practices, treat investments from different countries equally, and foster an open, fair and equitable business environment.\\n\\n## What triggered this change?\\n\\nThe intent, clearly, is to curb \"opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of\\nIndian companies due to the current COVID-19 pandemic.\"\\n\\nThere is a fear that given the global economic meltdown, fallen stock markets,\\nand the increase in distressed assets, China, through its state owned\\ncompanies and investment arms, might look at opportunistic purchases in\\nstrategic interests in various countries.\\n\\n  * **The key trigger:** The alarm bells rang after the People\\'s Bank of China increased its shareholding in HDFC Bank, one of India\\'s largest private sector banks, to 1.01%, between January and March 2020.\\n  * Following an uproar by British legislators, an arm of the Chinese state-owned investment firm China Reform had to abandon its bid to dominate Imagination, a leading British technology firm that makes smartphone chips, reports Foreign Policy.\\n  * The European Commission has issued guidelines to protect critical European assets and technology in current crisis\\n  * Fears regarding acquisitions in other countries.

This is\\nwhy there was a strong push from Indian entrepreneurs for differential voting\\nrights.\\n\\nThis additional restriction on investment will have the following impact:\\n\\n  * **Slow down in the pace of investment from Chinese companies in India** , because of the bureaucratic layer being added. The additional layer of scrutiny on every investment might also make Chinese investors vary of investing in India.\\n  * **A new trade issue:** This will, without doubt, become a trade issue eventually, and China will seek its relaxation in exchange for some concessions in the future. Perhaps a relaxation of sorts might eventually be in the offing (applicable to investments over x% or x amount, for example).\\n  * **New investments?** Those with investment from Chinese companies will look to add investors from other geographies, given that Indian investors typically do not/cannot invest at unicorn-scale.\\n\\n## Who will this impact?\\n\\nInvestments from China in India have largely mirrored successful businesses in\\nIndia.

In some cases, the premium on the shares was more than double the valuation. What is more interesting is that these valuations — done in November 2019, when the coronavirus pandemic was yet to grip the world — more than doubled within a couple of months. By the look of it, the coronavirus crisis seemed to have significantly raised optimism among investors about these Indian technology companies at a time when some global and Indian stock markets were witnessing a veritable bloodbath.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tAccording to valuation documents, in November 2019, the price of a single preference share of Byju’s was pegged at Rs 70,577 ($928).

Two months later, in January 2020, Alibaba group’s Ant Financial paid Rs 2.94 lakh ($3861) per share — again, twice the official valuation of pre-coronavirus days. In Paytm’s case, Discovery Capital in February 2020 paid a 50 per cent premium over its November valuation of Rs 12345 ($162) a share.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\tOfficial valuers had in November 2019 estimated Byju’s revenue to touch Rs 16,444 crore (over $2 billion) by 2022-23 – almost three-fold growth over 2021-22. Its profits were expected to grow almost eight times over. Zomato was expected to follow a similar trajectory during this period.

Ji Rong, the spokesperson for the Chinese embassy asked India to “revise discriminatory practices” and “treat investments from different countries equally”.Until now, a non-resident entity or a foreign investor could invest in India, subject to FDI rules, except in sectors/activities which are prohibited. However, countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan could invest only after government approvals and only in select sectors.But the Covid-19 crisis has dramatically transformed the business landscape across the world, with many Indian startups and tech companies seeing their valuations slump.This raised concerns about companies selling off stake at a discount as they scramble to stay afloat in an uncertain economic environment.The influence of Chinese investment in India’s startups have been growing. The statistics are telling.According to a recent study by Gateway House: Indian Council on Global Relations, a foreign policy think-tank, 18 of the 30 Indian unicorns (companies valued at more than $1 billion) have a Chinese investor.“This means that China is embedded in Indian society, the economy, and the technology ecosystem that influences it,” the report said. “Unlike a port or a railway line, these are invisible assets in small sizes – rarely over $100 million – and made by the private sector, which doesn’t cause immediate alarm”.Gateway House has identified over 75 companies, with Chinese investors concentrated in e-commerce, fintech, media/social media, aggregation services and logistics. A majority – more than half – of India’s 30 Indian unicorns (start-ups with valuation of over $1 billion) have a Chinese investor.These include storied names such as PayTM, Oyo, BigBasket, Ola, PolicyBazaar and Delhivery among others.National Security Advisor Ajit Doval has been flagging concerns over Chinese dominance in India’s booming tech space over the last few years, particularly pointing out worrying possibilities of Beijing’s state-funded apparatus controlling startups here through opaque corporate structures.Top government sources told Hindustan Times that the national security planners believed that firewalls were needed as India and China had many outstanding disputes and legacy issues.These primarily related to the unresolved 3,488 kilometre-long boundary dispute apart from Beijing using Islamabad as a proxy to hit at New Delhi on all fronts including keeping Jammu and Kashmir on a permanent boil.Until the spread of Covid-19, Raisina Hill was not warm to the idea of government oversight on Chinese FDI, with a strand of thought dominating that such a move could affect FDI inflows into India. Besides, it was felt that it could unsettle the fragile equilibrium in India-China bilateral relations, sources pointed out.The institutional knowledge of economic affairs, commerce and industry as well as ministry of external affairs relegated such a policy proposal change to the back burner.The Covid-19 outbreak provided an opportunity to Modi 2.0 to operationalize the FDI changes, with the proposal now enjoying bi-partisan support within India’s security and policy brainstrust.The Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Modi cleared the policy on April 17 with total support from Home Minister Amit Shah. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar and Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal.That this was an idea whose time had come hit home on February 1, when the government realised that there was hardly any Indian company that was manufacturing either personal protective equipment, ventilators or masks that the whole world is shopping for in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.Concessions to Chinese imports had also virtually pushed manufacturing out of the country including production of the much-needed critical active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs).There have also been concerns within the government that its signature “Make in India” initiative, first launched in 2014 to turn India into a manufacturing powerhouse, was being severely impacted by the allowances that had been extended to China.China is India’s largest bilateral merchandise trading partner, but the balance of trade is heavily tilted in favour of Beijing.Total India-China bilateral trade stood at USD 95.7 billion in 2019, with a deficit of USD 58 billion in favour of Beijing.The total Chinese FDI investment as per industry is USD 6.2 billion in India.The latest move is part of a series of steps that the government has taken since the start of this week after Housing Development Finance Corp. Ltd (HDFC) said that People’s Bank of China (PBOC) had raised its stake in the home lender from 0.8% to 1.01% in the March quarter through open market purchases.This led many to voice concerns that India’s systemically-important companies could be vulnerable to creeping take over from foreign investors, aided by dropping valuations.'}, {'headline': 'Covid-19 impact: Technology start-ups have multiple silver linings', 'url': 'http://business-standard.com/article/companies/covid-19-impact-technology-start-ups-have-multiple-silver-linings-120042100822_1.html', 'section': 'Companies', 'body': ' When Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed his mask while speak during his televised address to the nation on April 14, the business world was gasping. India had been under a nationwide lockdown for 21 days to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, and that had kept economic activity across the country on hold. Like all other industries, the tech start-up sector had been hoping for the curbs to be lifted. App-based commerce businesses — from cabs to general e-commerce — had been non-operational for nearly a month.  PM Modi, however, kept the lockdown in place, extending it till May 3. But he suggested all e-commerce services might be allowed from April 20 as part of relaxations for some sectors. And then came the rude shock: Just a day before e-commerce was supposed to open, the government made a U-turn and said the status quo should be maintained.  This back-and-forth by the government, and the uncertainty of the whole situation – a novel virus that has no cure – has been a massive curveball for start-ups, and the impact is still unfolding.  Impact on the tech world  The impact has been disparate across the technology world. Online travel platforms, hotel aggregators, flight booking sites, cab-booking apps and real estate-related services have been shut since March 24. They have had zero sales, and this scenario is unlikely to change for several months.  On the other hand, digital services — from social media, to online video streaming, e-learning, news, digital payments and e-health — are all seeing a boom. But this surge might not be sustainable, say experts, as people would pull back on their discretionary spending in the near future.  The impact is also disparate across segments of e-commerce, India’s biggest start-up sub-sector, where sale of groceries and food-related essentials are permitted during the lockdown. Everything else, including electronics and mobiles, which account of for 60-70 per cent of these companies’ yearly revenues, have been shut.  A study in contrast are food-delivery apps, which have stayed afloat by convincing the authorities that folks need their favourite cuisine delivered to their homes during lockdown. However, as most restaurants stay shut, their services are also limited.   ALSO READ: This small-cap company has found its watershed moment in Covid-19 pandemic   Cost-cutting  Retrenchment and salary cuts have hit start-ups hard. The most impacted are the ones related to airlines and hotel industries. Ixigio, US-listed MakeMyTrip, Goibibo and RedBus have all announced salary cuts. Fabhotels has laid off 20 per cent of its workforce, and Oyo has asked thousands of its employees, mostly those in China and the US, to go on leave without pay.  The so-called unicorns – start-ups valued at over $1 billion – are also spooked, as most of them tread on marginal runways, with monthly sales barely funding outsized operations. But it is the little guys, early-stage start-ups, that are the ones facing an existential crisis. All new funding discussions have stalled and funds are doubling down to support their existing portfolios.  “After a good start to 2020 for PE/VC investments, both investment and exit activities declined considerably in February 2020,” says Vivek Soni, partner and national leader (private equity services), EY. Investments in February declined 30 per cent from the previous month, and could slump even more.  Calls to save the digital and start-up ecosystem have gained steam. On April 9, a collective of two dozen start-up founders and top VCs — from Mohit Bhatnagar of Sequoia to Paytm’s Vijay Shekhar Sharma — wrote to the government for a “robust relief package”. The wish list included paying salaries for only 50 per cent of the workforce, interest-free loans, waiver of office rent, and tax benefits.  The government has also acted to prevent hostile takeover by foreign investors. It changed foreign direct investment (FDI) rules on April 19, which now mandates that all deal proposals from entities in countries sharing borders with India — China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc — have to be approved by the government.  The idea is to prevent hostile and opportunistic takeovers, especially by Chinese entities, which have high interests in Indian firms, experts say.  Pivots and partnerships  Since the novel coronavirus was first discovered in China in late December, infections from across the globe have nearly reached the 2.5 million mark, and fatalities stand at 170,000. While analysts are at a loss to estimate the business impact, the broad consensus is that it will be a protracted recovery over 8-10 months, and some sectors will face a more significant churn than others.  “Pivot is the new name of the game for all start-ups. Somewhere it is a complete pivot, and somewhere partial,” says Sanjay Mehta of 100x.vc, a newly-founded early-stage venture capital firm.  At least five unrelated players that ordinarily deal in other products have started selling groceries, listed as an essential service by the government, on their platforms. These are Zomato (in partnership with Grofers), Meesho (via Ninjakart), Paytm Mall (via Dealshare), Perpule (via Vishal Megamart) and NoBroker (via BigBasket).  A recent media report suggested Grofers and Zomato (they have Sequoia as a common investor) might be exploring a merger, but the discussions would move slowly, given the extraordinary times.  Meanwhile, since schools and universities are shut, edu-tech companies are having a field day. Byju’s, the country’s largest online education start-up valued at $8 billion, is offering its products for free. Others like Facebook-backed Unacademy and Toppr have followed suit by putting out free subscription.  Reorganisation  The lockdown has forced start-ups to move quickly. Grofers, the leading grocery firm, opened a new warehouse in Gurgaon in two weeks and hired hundreds of new workers. “We figured that if we could not have more people in the same warehouse — because of social-distancing norms — we should open a new facility,” explains founder and CEO Albinder Dhindsa.  Grofers’ services, closed for 5 days during the early days of the lockdown, were reopened gradually. “Now we are operating at 90 per cent of our pre-Covid capacity but the demand is too high. We are able to open (ordering) slots only for 15 minutes in a day,” says Dhindsa.  Others, meanwhile, are transitioning to take whatever benefit they can from a sharp uptick in digital consumption. For instance, Cure.fit, which operates over 200 gyms across the country, is streaming online workout sessions.  Co-founder and CEO Ankit Nagori says these online workout sessions are attended by 25,000 people daily, and the number is growing by 5-10 per cent each day. Cure.fit has also added telemedicine, and plans to launch psychological care sessions, and a Covid-19 testing solution in partnership with testing centres.  Digital services thrive  For digital-only services — those like Facebook, Instagram, Sharechat, Netflix, Gaana, MX Player and TikTok — the lockdown has had a positive impact.  “Over the past three weeks, our platform has witnessed a 2x increase in time spent across genres,” says Karan Bedi, CEO of MX Player, an over-the-top (OTT) platform. Owing to the surge, Netflix\\' stock in the US hit a 52-week high recently.  Not only is traffic higher but platforms are also adding new users – even those who earlier were not on social media or watched OTTs. “There is an expansion in demographics,” says Jehil Thakkar, partner (media & entertainment), Deloitte India. “In that sense, it is a plus for digital entertainment and social media platforms. But it remains to be seen whether this is only a momentary blip or will continue this way.”  “Consumption is up, but monetisation is a question”, adds Thakkar.  For platforms linked to tangible services, the situation is grim. Ola and Uber have completely ceased passenger cab operations. Their gimmickry of positioning themselves as services for health practitioners during this crisis has not yielded results. Uber’s tie-up with grocery chains for delivery is currently the only area where it is operational, albeit in a limited manner.  They fear that thousands of cab drivers who have financed cars through them will be unable to pay back. This might become a bad-loan crisis for banks, Ola said in a letter to the government on March 24.  What lies ahead  Estimates for how the Indian economy will fare, given how things stand today, are now beginning to come. British bank Barclays estimated a $234.4-billion economic loss for India, and forecast nil gross domestic product (GDP) growth this calendar year. The World Bank lowered its forecast on India’s GDP growth to between 1.5 per cent and 4 per cent during FY21 from 6.5 per cent earlier.  Sequoia, a storied venture capital firm, has told founders to conserve as much cash as possible. “Focus on quality of revenue, margins, etc, as opposed to growth at all costs through discounts. It is okay to reduce growth rates. Survive at all costs, and focus on getting to 18-24 months of cash runway,” Sequoia India’s Bhatnagar said in a video session for founders arranged by TiE.  Even if the lockdown is lifted on May 3, experts do not see most players recouping their losses during this period. \"E-commerce firms may get users to shop more with special sales events planned in May-June, but people won’t check into hotels more, or take more Uber rides just because the lockdown is lifted,\" explains Gaurav Rastogi, CEO of mutual funds platform Kuvera.  “If this becomes a deep recession, all non-essential services will be at risk,” Rastogi says, even as he predicts a “savings bonanza”. People are saving more money with a curtailed expenditure. These extra savings by people who have their jobs — this is a majority group — could cause a demand uptick once the lockdown eases. “People might want to upgrade their smartphones or buy a new car. Some part of that extra private savings would come into investments — fixed deposits or equities.”  “Another consequence of the lockdown will be a shortage of some food items,\" says Vasu Chinnathambi, co-founder of India’s largest grocery supply chain start-up Ninjakart. “A challenge on the sourcing side will be the availability (of vegetables) in a month or two months from now. A lot of farmers are not harvesting or sowing new crops. This means there will be less availability in two months’ time, and prices will go up.” '}, {'headline': 'Coronavirus Layoffs: ViacomCBS, Cantor Fitzgerald Latest To Shed Jobs Amid Pandemic', 'url':

That’s how many U.S. companies are considering layoffs, according to a survey released by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the country’s oldest outplacement firm.

The numbers come on the heels of the 22 million American workers who\\xa0filed for unemployment since the crisis began, according to data released Thursday, an all-time high. \\nKey background: There are now over 776,000 reported coronavirus cases in the U.S. and more than 41,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide cases now amount to over 2.4 million infected and 168,000 dead. Meanwhile, President Trump signed a coronavirus relief bill into law that provides free testing and paid sick leave, along with a $2 trillion stimulus package. At least 42 states have enacted stay-at-home orders that affect 316 million people or more. Cancelations of concerts, sports leagues, festivals, religious gatherings and other large events have impacted millions of people. President Trump enacted a 30 day travel ban from Europe that sent airlines and travelers scrambling to adjust, before declaring a national state of emergency. Some states, like South Carolina and North Dakota, are beginning to ease restrictions, but most health experts agree that social distancing and business shutdowns continue to be necessary to reduce the virus’ spread. But the uncertainty over when the country—and its citizens—can resume normal life is a specter hanging over businesses, as they decide whether to cut workers.\\nFurther reading: \\nTracker: Media Layoffs, Furloughs And Pay Cuts Due To Coronavirus (Noah Kirsch)Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus\\n\"}, {'headline': '‘डिजिटल इंडिया’ पर चीन की मजबूत पकड़, सरकार इसे कमजोर कर पाएगी?', 'url': 'http://hindi.thequint.com/business/aapka-paisa/china-controls-digital-india-amita-bhandari-exclusive-interview', 'section': None, 'body': 'चीन ने चुपके से भारत के टेक स्टार्टअप्स में पिछले पांच वर्षों में चार बिलियन डॉलर लगाए. यह रकम बड़ी नहीं है, लेकिन 92 कंपनियों में ये जो निवेश है, उससे भारत की ऑनलाइन दुनिया पर अपना दबदबा खूब बढ़ाया है. भारत में 30 यूनीकॉर्न (एक अरब डॉलर वैल्यूएशन वाली कंपनियां) हैं, जिनमें से18 में चीन के निवेशकों का पैसा लगा है. इस तरह चीन ने भारत के इर्दगिर्द वर्चुअल बेल्ट एंड रोड इनिशिएटिव बना दिया है.HDFC में बैंक ऑफ चाइना का निवेश बढ़ने के बाद नियम बदलाअब जब ये खबर सामने आई कि चीन ने पीपल्स बैंक ऑफ चाइना ने HDFC में अपने निवेश को बढ़ाकर एक पर्सेंट से ज़्यादा कर दिया तब भारत सरकार जागी. उसने विदेशी निवेश के नियमों में इस हफ्ते बदलाव किया.अब चीन समेत दूसरे पड़ोसी देशों से भारत में निवेश अब ऑटोमैटिक नहीं, बल्कि सरकार से मंजूरी से के बाद ही आ सकता है.कोरोना की महामारी के बाद ये डर है कि भारत की कंपनियों का वैल्युएशन गिरेगा तो विदेशी कंपनियां उन्हें ख़रीदने के लिए दौड़ी आएंगी. भारत की पाबंदियों के बाद चीन के साथ हमारे रिश्तों पर क्या असर पड़ेगा. इसपर हमने फॉरेन पॉलिसी थिंक टैंक गेटवे हाउस के फेलो अमित भंडारी से बात की. गेटवे हाउस ने हाल ही में भारत में चीनी निवेश पर एक विस्तृत रिपोर्ट तैयार की थी.आज फेसबुक, एप्पल जैसी कंपनियां अमेरिका के लिए जो मायने रखती हैं, कल यही मायना oyo, बिग बास्केट, ओला भारत के लिए रखेंगी.  तो क्या आज ही ये कंपनियां विदेशी कंपनियों के हाथों बेच दी जाएं या इसे रोका जाए?अमित भंडारी, फेलो, फॉरेन पॉलिसी थिंक टैंक गेटवे हाउस92 भारतीय कंपनियों में चीनी निवेशटिकटॉक, अलीबाबा, टेनसेंट, शाओमी, और ओप्पो हमारे यहां छाए हुए हैं. पेटीएम का 40% शेयर अलीबाबा के पास है. फ्लिपकार्ट, स्नैपडील, स्विगी, जोमैटो, ओला, ओयो, बिग बास्केट, उड़ान समेत 92 कंपनियों में चीनी निवेश मौजूद है.भारत की बड़ी टेक कंपनियों में चीनियों ने पहले ही हिस्सेदारी लेनी शुरू कर दी. ऐसा इसलिए हुआ कि भारत में इतने अमीर वेंचर कैपिटलिस्ट नहीं थे जो इन कंपनियों में पैसा लगा सकते. भारत की नीतियां देशी निवेशकों को हतोत्साहित करती हैं. चीन ने इसी कमजोरी का फ़ायदा उठाया.चीन ने पाकिस्तान, श्रीलंका, म्यान्मार और बांग्लादेश में फिजिकल इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर में पैसे लगाए और भारत में उसने डिजिटल इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर में. भारत में चीन का चार बिलियन निवेश बड़ी बात नहीं लेकिन उसके अनुपात में उसकी मौजूदगी और असर भारत पर बहुत ज़्यादा है.भारत में टिक टॉक ने वॉट्सऐप और दूसरे कई अमेरिकन प्लैटफॉर्म्स को न सिर्फ कड़ा मुकाबला दिया है बल्कि पीछे छोड़ दिया है.आज इंटरनेट की दुनिया में एक तरफ अमेरिकी कंपनियां और दूसरी तरफ चीन की कंपनियां कड़े मुकाबले में है और हर तरह के डेटा को कंट्रोल करना चाहती हैं इसीलिए प्राइवेसी, सेंसरशिप, राष्ट्रीय सुरक्षा, डेटा कंट्रोल डेटा लोकलाइजेशन जैसे मुद्दे भारत के लिए बेहद महत्वपूर्ण हो गए हैं. ये हमको पहले से पता है लेकिन अभी तक सरकार बढ़िया क़ानून बनाने के मामले में धीमे चल रही है.‘देश में कितने कोरोना केस,सरकार के पास नहीं डेटा’:Exclusive बातचीत कोरोनावायरस से जारी जंग के बीच तमाम अपडेट्स और जानकारी के क्लिक कीजिए यहां (हैलो दोस्तों! हमारे Telegram और WhatsApp चैनल से जुड़े रहिए यहां)'}, {'headline': 'Battered by Covid-19 lockdown, India’s formal sector is resorting to massive layoffs and pay cuts', 'url': 'http://scroll.in/article/959485/battered-by-covid-19-lockdown-indias-formal-sector-is-resorting-to-massive-layoffs-and-pay-cuts', 'section': None, 'body': '\\nAs the Indian economy falters due to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak, millions of jobs, across sectors, are on the line.Estimates released by the National Sample Survey and Periodic Labour Force Surveys on March 31 suggested that over 136 million non-agricultural jobs are at immediate risk. Workers without formal employment contracts, casual labourers, those who work in small companies, and the self-employed, are the most vulnerable.“It is a situation many of us have never been faced with. The coronavirus outbreak will bring a shift in the way companies function,” said Sudeep Kumar Sen, a spokesperson for HR firm TeamLease Services.So far, India’s estimated 120 million migrant labourers, who work for daily wages, have borne the brunt of the crisis. Unable to afford rent or food in cities and, with public transport shut down, thousands of them have trekked the hundreds of miles to their homes in the hinterland.In the formal economy, the sectors that will receive no relief even after April 20, when India’s relaxed lockdown guidelines kick in, will be the worst hit. “Travel & tourism, leisure and hospitality, and automobile sectors have been hit really badly,” said Swetha Harikrishnan, human resource director at HackerEarth, a Bengaluru-based talent assessment platform.Quartz takes a look at various sectors that have started to give the pink slips.Endless worries for ITOver 1.5 lakh people across India’s various information technology firms are expected to lose their jobs in the coming months, as per an April 3 report by Moneycontrol, which cited human resource experts. The sector’s reliance on exports to western markets has made it vulnerable.“More than 75% of the industry’s revenues are sourced from exports to large markets like North America and Europe. The spread of coronavirus in these two markets will create ripple effects in the Indian IT industry,” said rating agency CARE in a note on April 14. Indian IT will witness revenue growth of 3%-5% in the Financial Year 2021, compared with 7.7% in FY20, the note added.The smaller firms are already taking a hit.Over 490 IT employees in Bengaluru and West Bengal have lost their jobs so far, according to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions.On March 20, Techolution, a New York-based global technology business consultancy in Hyderabad laid off its 20 employees, citing a market slowdown due to the global coronavirus, as per a report in Huffington Post.However, the larger behemoths may not stay immune. “The bigger firms may not be letting go of their permanent staff as of now, but after two or three months, they will feel the pressure and may not just keep on providing subsidies to the employees,” R Chandrashekhar, a former president of industry body Nasscom, told news agency PTI on April 12.Startups in the same boatIndia’s startup ecosystem is also staring at monstrous losses. Many are instituting layoffs or pay cuts as fears intensify. “The startups that are $10-20-50 million in size have to do cost-cutting. The main cost-cutting in this business is people,” Venture capitalist M Rangaswami told PTI  on April 14.On April 13, Ritesh Agarwal, founder and CEO of hospitality major OYO, in a video message uploaded on YouTube, said that the outbreak of coronavirus has severely impacted travel and tourism. Since the outbreak, OYO’s occupancy rate and revenues have dropped by 50-60% and the company’s balance sheet has come under severe stress, he added.Indian social commerce startup Meesho is reported to have laid off over 200 employees. Besides, over 100 people were asked to leave the Bengaluru-based scooter rental startup Bounce. Insurance startup Acko, too, reportedly let go of 45-50 employees.Expecting the worse, on April 10, a number of startup founders, and venture capitalists requested the government to grant them a “robust relief package” to help combat severe impact their business may face due to Covid-19.The startups requested the government to bankroll 50% of their workforce’s salaries for six months, provide interest-free loans, waive rent for three months, and offer tax benefits.MediaMany prominent media houses have sanctioned layoffs or mandatory leave without pay.While The Indian Express and Business Standard have announced pay cuts, others are also taking steps to curb costs. On April 10, 15 employees of  News Nation, a Hindi news national channel, were asked to leave with immediate effect. “We have asked to leave citing the slowdown from coronavirus outbreak, there’s a team member who has become a parent of twins recently, his wife is still in the hospital, and at this time when the company was supposed to help, we have been asked not to come to the office,” a senior staff member from the sacked team of News Nation told Quartz.On April 13, digital news website The Quint asked about 45 employees to go on indefinite leave without pay. The organisation faced “a truly unprecedented situation…in these circumstances, it is clear that our revenues will be under severe strain over the next 3-4 months,” said an email sent by its HR department to staff, a copy of which Quartz reviewed.Times Life, the Sunday supplement of the Times of India, also asked its employees to leave on April 13.AviationOn April 15, global airlines’ grouping International Air Transport Association noted that more than 20 lakh jobs are at risk in India’s aviation sector.“Passenger revenue is expected to fall by more than $8.8 billion and passenger demand decline by 36%,” Albert Tjoeng, assistant director for corporate communications at International Air Transport Association, said.Some domestic airlines, such as SpiceJet and GoAir, have resorted to leave without pay and layoffs of expat pilots.“The April-June period, traditionally one of the stronger quarters for Indian airlines, is increasingly looking like a washout. This will have implications for July-September [usually the weakest quarter] and for the rest of the financial year 2021,” said Sydney-based Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, in a report published in March-end.Hospitality and tourismTravel restrictions, including in India, are paralysing the hospitality sector too. Seeking financial relief from the government, industry body, the Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India released a statement on April 15 citing potential job loss. “The hospitality and tourism sector accounts for 12.75% of employment, 5.56% of it is direct and 7.19% indirect. As we speak, the Indian hospitality and tourism industry is staring at a potential job loss of around 38 million, which is 70% of the total workforce, due to Covid-19.”Export sectorThe coronavirus scare has crippled the sector completely. In March, India’s merchandise exports shrunk by a record 34.6%, while imports declined 28.7% as countries sealed their borders to combat the virus.Like the hospitality industry, the export sector, too, is demanding the government to intervene to save it from the massive crisis.Over 1.5 crore people in India could lose their jobs in the wake of gloomy global trade trends due to Covid-19, predicted industry body, Federation of Indian Export Organisation on April 10. The sectors that are heavily dependent on exports are apparel, gems, jewellery, handicrafts, engineering among others.The apparel exports sector alone estimates 2.5-3 million job losses because of order cancellations.What’s next?Despite the horrible situation, experts have found the silver lining. “There are companies that have viewed this as an excellent environment to pick up top talent. They have used this opportunity to think of their post-pandemic recovery and regrowth phase. And technology will be significantly utilised, in this phase and after,” said Vikram Ahuja, co-founder of Talent500 by ANSR, a talent recruiting firm for the IT sector.Experts advise employees with job security to be adaptive to change, and those who’ve lost jobs to make use of the opportunity. “Sacked employees need to be open to re-purposing and up-skilling. This is an opportunity to invest in up-skilling. Be open to freelancing and remote jobs, as there are opportunities there too,” said Harikrishnan. “Unpredictability is high, which also means job opportunities might open up with a big bang in digital in a few months.”This article first appeared on Quartz.\\n\\n'}, {'headline': 'How China dominates tech investments in India', 'url': 'http://thehindubusinessline.com/info-tech/how-china-dominates-tech-investments-in-india/article31380773.ece', 'section': 'Info-tech', 'body': \"\\nThe Centre's decision to impose restrictions on investments coming in from neighbouring countries especially China could have an impact on the start up segment.Chinese investors have already cornered major stake in 18 out of India’s top 30 Unicorns.A recent report by foreign policy think tank ‘Gateway House: Indian Council on Global Relations,’ has estimated China linked investments in India’s tech start-up sector alone at $4 billion. These investments could be small, but China via tech sector is embedded in Indian society and holds influence due to the nature of tech investments. \\n\\xa0Also, China holds control over other widely used foreign apps in India, as per the report published in March 2020.Chinese investments have come under scrutiny recently in the wake of Covid-19 epidemic, which is said to have been originated in China.The companies which have major Chinese investments include Big Basket, Byju’s, Delhivery, Dream 11, Flipkart, Hike, MakeMyTrip, Ola, Oyo, Paytm, Paytm Mall, PolicyBazzar, Quikr, Rivigo, Snapdeal, Swiggy, Uddan, Zomato are some where Chinese companies hold stake.Chinese FDI into IndiaChinese FDI into India is small at $6.2 billion, but its impact is already outsized, given the increasing penetration of tech in India, the report says. “Chinese funding to Indian tech start-ups is making an impact disproportionate to its value, given the deepening penetration of technology across sectors in India. TikTok, owned by ByteDance, is already one of the most popular apps in India, overtaking YouTube; Xiaomi handsets are bigger than Samsung smartphones; Huawei routers are widely used. These are investments made by nearly two dozen Chinese tech companies and funds, led by giants like Alibaba, ByteDance and Tencent which have funded 92 Indian start-ups, including unicorns such as Paytm, Byju’s, Oyo and Ola. China is embedded in Indian society, the economy, and the technology ecosystem that influences it,” the report said.The report says that unlike a port or a railway line, Chinese tech investments are invisible assets in small sizes – rarely over $100 million – and made by the private sector, which doesn’t cause immediate alarm. All this adds up to just 1.5% of the total official Chinese (including Hong Kong) FDI into India.This doesn’t cover investments made by funds based out of Singapore and elsewhere, where the ultimate owner is Chinese, so the actual investment in India will be higher.The single largest Chinese investment in India is the $1.1 billion acquisition of Gland Pharma by Fosun in 2018. This accounts for 17.7% of all Chinese FDI into India, but it is unique, the report said. Gateway House identified just five other investments by Chinese companies which exceed $100 million. This includes the $300-million investment by MG Motors. China is most active in India in the start-up space. Gateway House has identified over 75 companies, with Chinese investors concentrated in e-commerce, fintech, media/social media, aggregation services and logistics. A majority – more than half – of India’s 30 Indian unicorns (start-ups with valuation of over $1 billion) have a Chinese investor.Overseas venture capital (VC) fundingThe report says that Indian start-ups rely disproportionately on overseas venture capital (VC) funding – all start-ups worth over $1 billion are foreign-funded. “Some like Flipkart and Paytm have been acquired outright. India still does not have a Sequoia or Google of its own. Reliance Industries, through Jio, is trying to replicate Alibaba’s successful model in India,” the report claims.According to the analysis, some large Chinese investing companies have their own ecosystems, which include online stores, payment gateways, messaging services, etc. An investment by a Chinese firm can pull the Indian company into this ecosystem, which may mean loss of control over data.Typically, in investments by a consortium of venture capitalists, one of the partners takes the lead in advising the start-up. Chinese investors can encourage the start-up to use pre-existing Chinese solutions for its tech requirements – again leading to loss of control over data. If this process is followed across a range of companies – a taxi service, a hotel aggregator, online retail outlets, a payment provider – it permits an intrusive, comprehensive profile of an individual and his/her habits.\\n\\n\"}, {'headline': 'The UK Market Opportunity Awaiting Indian Tech Startups', 'url': 'http://inc42.com/resources/startup-scenario-in-india-and-the-uk', 'section': None, 'body': 'Startups have gained momentum around the world in the last decade and are\\ndriving economic growth.

Previously, only investments from Pakistan and Bangladesh faced such restrictions.The revised FDI policy is aimed at “curbing opportunistic takeovers/acquisitions of Indian companies due to the current COVID-19 pandemic,” said a press release from the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade on Saturday.Also read | People\\'s Bank of China picks up 1% stake in HDFC‘With land borders’“A non-resident entity can invest in India, subject to the FDI Policy except in those sectors/activities which are prohibited,” says the new policy.“However, an entity of a country, which shares land border with India or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in or is a citizen of any such country, can invest only under the Government route.” Pakistani investors face further restrictions in requiring government approval for FDI in defence, space and atomic energy sectors as well.India shares land borders with Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh and Myanmar. Investors from countries not covered by the new policy only have to inform the RBI after a transaction rather than asking for prior permission from the relevant government department.With many Indian businesses coming to a halt due to the lockdown imposed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic and valuations plummeting, a number of domestic firms may be vulnerable to “opportunistic takeovers or acquisitions” from foreign players. Last week, housing finance company HDFC informed the stock exchanges that the People’s Bank of China now holds a 1.01% stake in the company. This was an instance of portfolio investment through the stock market and not FDI.Also read | New FDI rules may have unintended effectsThe official statement added that a transfer of ownership of any existing or future FDI in an Indian entity to those in the restricted countries would also need government approval. The decisions will become effective from the date of the Foreign Exchange Management Act notification“Given the macro situation, it is a measure to protect vulnerable companies, with possibly low valuations, from unwelcome takeovers. However, while the DPIIT has set out its policy stance, the Non Debt Rules that the Ministry of Finance will publish in this regard is awaited, as that will set out the different scenarios which will trigger the Central Government approval requirement and other considerations regarding foreign investments from our neighbours,\" said Aarthi Sivanandh who specialises in corporate law at Partner, J Sagar Associates.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The official statement added that any further sale of FDI to investors in neighbouring countries would also have to comply with the new policy, with each subsequent change in ownership through transfer of investment to also requiring government approval. The decision will become effective from the date of the Foreign Exchange Management Act notification.China\\'s footprint in the Indian business space has been expanding rapidly, especially since 2014.Editorial | Tinkering for optics: On FDI rule changesA recent report from Brookings India showed that net Chinese investment in India until 2014 stood at $1.6 billion, mostly coming from state-owned players in the infrastructure space. Three years later, total investment had increased five-fold to at least $8 billion according to Chinese government data, with a shift from a state-driven to market-driven approach. The total current and planned Chinese investment in India has now crossed $26 billion, according to estimates in the March 2020 Brookings reportpaper, titled \"Following the Money: China Inc\\'s Growing Stake in India-China Relations\".The single biggest Chinese acquisition has been in the pharmaceutical space, with Shanghai-based Fosun paying $1.09 billion for a 74% stake in Hyderabad-based Gland Pharma.However, major Chinese investments in India span a range of sectors. A 2017 survey of Chinese enterprises in India by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China\\'s Mumbai branch found that 42% were in the manufacturing sector, 25% in infrastructure and others in telecom, petrochemicals, software and IT. The Brookings paper also tracked major investments in energy, where three out of four Indian power plants use Chinese equipment, automobiles, real estate and consumer goods, especially the mobile phone segment, where Chinese brands dominate the smartphone market.Perhaps the most underestimated aspect of Chinese investment has been the way that Chinese capital now undergirds the technology start-up space in India, with Chinese venture capitalists funding household names such as Paytm, Flipkart, Swiggy, Zomato, Oyo, Ola, BigBasket, Byju\\'s, SnapDeal, Quikr and MakeMyTrip.A February 2020 report by the Gateway House think tank estimates that Chinese giants such as Alibaba and Tencent have funded at least 92 Indian start-ups. \"This means that China is embedded in Indian society, the economy, and the technology ecosystem that influences it. Unlike a port or a railway line, these are invisible assets in small sizes – rarely over $100 million – and made by the private sector, which doesn’t cause immediate alarm,\" said the report. \\n\\xa0The Brookings paper also noted that the flush of investment from China’s private sector poses new challenges for India’s regulators and warned that boundaries between China\\'s state and private sectors are blurry at best, with some of China’s most prominent private technology companies -- including those that are major investors in India -- playing key roles in advancing government initiatives at home, including in running an effective censorship regime.\"This blurred separation between state-owned enterprise and private enterprise raises the question of whether the Chinese private sector can indeed be considered as an entirely distinct entity from the state. This question becomes even more relevant with Chinese and other foreign firms acquiring controlling stakes in Indian companies, particularly in the technology sector where definitions of security or strategic implications are rapidly evolving,\" it said.\\n\\n'}, {'headline': 'New FDI rules may have unintended effects', 'url': 'http://thehindu.com/business/new-fdi-rules-may-have-unintended-effects/article31377764.ece', 'section': 'Business', 'body': \"\\nThe Ministry of Commerce press note amending the FDI policy to make investments from countries which ‘share a land border’ with India can only be construed as being aimed at Chinese investors. Such restrictions were already applicable to Pakistan and Bangladesh, while Myanmar, Bhutan, Nepal and Sri Lanka are not major investors in India. Alos read: EDITORIAL | Tinkering for optics: On FDI rule changesThe note makes clear its objective is to curb opportunistic takeovers or acquisitions due to the current COVID-19 pandemic. This is a likely reference to the possibility of Chinese investors purchasing undervalued shares of Indian-listed companies. This is indeed a risk that has also been identified by other countries. On April 12, news of an incremental purchase of shares in HDFC made by the People’s Bank of China made the headlines. This press note, however, does not restrict its application to such cases.A plain reading of the amended policy makes every type of investment by Chinese investors subject to government approval. It neither distinguishes between greenfield and brownfield investments nor listed and unlisted companies.It also does not distinguish between the different types of investors, such as industry players, financial institutions, or venture capital funds. Such a blanket application could create unintended problems. For instance, it is likely that unlisted or private companies might find themselves under financial stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. An acquisition in such companies can only occur between willing buyers and sellers. Making government approval necessary for acquisitions in private companies by Chinese investors will only reduce the number of potential investors available for a prospective seller, and drive down the valuation. The absence of a white knight may cause bankruptcy and job losses. Greenfield investments are another category where the new rules may pose obstacles. These are investments where Chinese investors bring fresh capital to establish new factories and generate employment in India. China has been the fastest growing source of FDI since 2014. The positive sentiment generated among industry players in China since then may well be punctured by the need for government approval. Moreover, the most visible ‘Chinese investors’ in India, most in the Internet space, may not even come under the definitions of the new rules. Most investors in companies such as Zomato, Swiggy, Bigbasket, Makemytrip, Oyo, Ola and Snapdeal are either venture capital funds registered in off-shore tax havens or listed in stock exchanges in the U.S. or Hong Kong. It will prove to be extremely difficult to attribute nationality to venture capital funds or fix the ultimate beneficial ownership of listed companies down to founders of a certain nationality. By abolishing the Foreign Investment Promotion Board in 2017, India took the decision of dismantling the last vestige of an FDI regime that sought to block sensitive foreign investments. What Delhi should have left behind then was a national security exception — along the lines of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) — to deal with genuine threats to national security or black swan events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Instead, issuing an amendment that reverses what has been a highly-advertised new FDI policy position may have unintended consequences in the minds of foreign investors.(The writer is Member, CII Core Group on China and Partner, Link Legal India.

Some had even described him as the de facto head of the government because in a country where the presidency holds an inordinate amount of centralized power and government funds, deciding who has access to the president accords immense power and influence.And even with a political culture overweighted in outsized egos, Nigeria’s government ministers and state governors had to learn to work by going through Kyari before getting to the ultimate “oga”.Despite his high profile role, the late chief of staff has not been one for the political limelight. There are few official public photographs of him and even his official age was not readily available in the early obituaries, though a tweet on Saturday from president Buhari confirmed he was 67.Kyari, who graduated from Cambridge and Warwick universities in the United Kingdom in the early 1980s, was often described as an intellectual by those who dealt with him.The late chief of staff was said to have contracted the coronavirus on an official trip to Germany in March. He was confirmed with the virus on Mar. 23. At the time, he was said to be in high spirits and widely expected to recover. But there have now been reports Kyari had underlying conditions.Kyari’s passing is a major blow to the Buhari presidency. It leaves a gaping hole in the administration as it juggles responding to a coronavirus outbreak—which is likely to tip Nigeria’s economy into its worst recession in 30 years according to the IMF—and battling multiple insecurity challenges, including a devastating Boko Haram insurgency that has left the military stretched. Kyari’s passing may also force president Buhari into a quick shake-up of his cabinet—a reality which flies in the face of the president’s preference for slow-paced decision making.Kyari was one of several high profile political figures in Nigeria to have contracted the virus. The state governors of Bauchi (Bala Mohammed) and Oyo (Seyi Makinde) both contracted the virus in March and have recovered. The Kaduna governor Nasir El-Rufai is still in care.Nigeria still has a relatively low number of confirmed coronavirus cases with just 493 and 17 deaths, relative to its 200 million population. But there have been significant concerns the country is not giving enough tests to be certain with around just 7,000 tests done.Additional reporting by Yomi Kazeem in LagosSign up to the\\xa0Quartz Africa Weekly Brief here for news and analysis on African business, tech and innovation in your inbox'}, {'headline': '‘Start-ups got $4 bn from Chinese investors in 5\\xa0years’', 'url': 'http://financialexpress.com/industry/sme/start-ups-got-4-bn-from-chinese-investors-in-5-years/1932051', 'section': None, 'body': 'Indian start-ups have received an estimated $4 billion in funding from China-based technology investors in the five years ended March 2020. As many as 18 of 30 unicorns in the segment are Chinese-funded, according to a report by Gateway House: Indian Council on Global Relations. Lack of deep-pocketed domestic venture investors for Indian start-ups has given China the opportunity to exploit the space, analysts in the report said. China also provides the “patient capital” needed to support the start-ups, most of which are in the red. Most Indian VC financiers are wealthy individuals/family offices and cannot make the $100-million commitments needed to finance start-ups through their early losses, the analyst said. The total losses for six top players — Paytm, Delhivery, Swiggy, OYO, Zomato and Grofers — rose to Rs 11,489.48 crore in FY19 compared to Rs 3,257.04 crore in FY18, an increase of 252.75%. Further, China sees lucrative retail and strategic value in the huge Indian market, the analysts noted. “Unable to persuade India to sign on to its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China has entered the Indian market through venture investments in start-ups,” the report said. Major players like BigBasket, Byju’s, Delhivery, Paytm, OYO, Swiggy, Zomato and Rivigo have been backed by Chinese investors. Earlier this year, Swiggy raised $113 million from investors including China’s Meituan Dianping. Paytm last year raised a whopping $1 billion led by US-based T Rowe Price with participation from Chinese-backer Ant Financial. “Paytm benefitted from Alibaba’s superior fintech experience, which it applied to India seamlessly, making it a dominant player,” the analysts said in the report. “India does not have a Sequoia or Google of its own. Reliance Industries, through Jio, is trying to replicate Alibaba’s successful model in India,” they added.

According to a Wall Street Journal report, OYO wants to put some of its employees on its investor SoftBank’s payrolls. SoftBank is OYO’s partner in its Japanese venture – OYO Life. OYO has turned to its partner and top investor SoftBank to help with its struggling business in Japan. According to a Wall Street Journal report, OYO wants to put some of its employees on its investor SoftBank’s payrolls. However, a report by Nikkei Asian Review states that Oyo Life had ‘already started transferring employees, mainly in sales, to other SoftBank affiliates in Japan, such as WeWork and mobile payment company PayPay.’ OYO is following a secondment scheme in Japan to cut costs. However, its dependency on SoftBank (who is also a partner in the Japanese venture) could be limited as the investment firm itself is set to post a record loss. SoftBank’s majestic $100 billion Vision Fund is headed for a $16.5 billion loss. The record loss for FY20 is because of ‘the deteriorating performance of its tech bets’. Meanwhile, the group as a whole will see a $12.5 billion loss. OYO’s Japan story Like all other hospitality chains, OYO is struggling under the coronavirus lockdown. Founder Ritesh Agarwal recently announced that its global revenues are down by 50-60%. The company also put hundreds of employees in the US on furloughs or temporary leaves. It has been a difficult year for the Indian unicorn OYO. From laying off hundreds of employees across geographies to increasing complaints from hotel owners about delayed payments, OYO has been in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Right before the lockdown, the company was already scripting a turnaround story in Japan where it’s just a year old. OYO Life booked 4,000 rooms in January 2020, said a blog post by Kavikrut and Prasun Choudhury, board members, for OYO LIFE, Japan and OYO Hotels, Japan respectively. This is high occupancy for the geography which has 5,800 rooms in total. OYO launched in Japan in 2019 and in the first year itself went through a whole list of ups and downs. Riding into the country on the back of its investor – SoftBank, OYO was hoping to make a splash, but it was soon mired in controversy. Yahoo bought 30% shares in OYO’s subsidiary company in Japan – OYO Life in March 2019. However, within seven months in November, Yahoo sold those shares back to OYO.

Lightspeed Venture Partners XIII has raised $890 million and will support early-stage companies from seed to Series-B rounds, while Lightspeed Venture Partners Select IV, which has a corpus of $1.83 billion, will look to accelerate existing portfolio companies and identify new investments.  Lightspeed Opportunity Fund, a new fund, will use $1.5 billion to invest in breakout companies across the markets that the multi-stage venture capital firm operates in, including China, India, Israel, Europe and Southeast Asia.  “Taken together, this capital framework across three funds will position the firm to continue to serve founding teams, technologies and trends that are accelerating the innovation economy. Lightspeed remains more committed than ever to the mission of serving the world’s most extraordinary people building tomorrow’s companies, today,” the firm said in a statement.  Lightspeed, which counts Snap, Guardant Health, AppDynamics, Goop and Nutanix, among its portfolio in the United States, has also been among the most active venture capital investors in India. In Asia’s third-largest economy, Lightspeed India Partners has been an early backer of hospitality chain Oyo Hotels & Hotels, ed-tech unicorn Byju’s and B2B ecommerce marketplace Udaan.  All the three Indian portfolio companies are currently valued at $1 billion or more. Additionally, it has also backed regional language-focused social networking and content platform Sharechat, book-keeping startup OKCredit and B2B logistics platform Freight Tiger, among others.  In India, the firm has a portfolio strength of 24 companies, according to its website.  Lightspeed India has also scored strong partial exits over the last 12 months, earning multibagger returns from the part sale of its stakes in Oyo and Byju’s.  The firm is estimated to have earned between $900 million and $1 billion from the two transactions.  “It is more evident than ever that entrepreneurship is global - 2019 was the first year in venture capital where more breakout companies emerged outside of the US than inside of it,” according to the company statement.  The Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm is also reportedly on the road for its third India-focused fund, which has a target corpus of $250-$300 million, and which could close by the end of the June quarter.  It had previously raised two India-focused funds - $135 million in 2015, and $175 million in 2018 - having first entered India in 2007 and investing out of the global fund at the time.

Workers without formal employment contracts, casual labourers, those who work in small companies, and the self-employed, are the most vulnerable.“It is a situation many of us have never been faced with. The coronavirus outbreak will bring a shift in the way companies function,” said Sudeep Kumar Sen, a spokesperson for HR firm TeamLease Services.So far, India’s estimated 120 million migrant labourers, who work for daily wages, have borne the brunt of the crisis. Unable to afford rent or food in cities and, with public transport shut down, thousands of them have trekked the hundreds of miles to their homes in the hinterland.In the formal economy, the sectors that will receive no relief even after April 20, when India’s relaxed lockdown guidelines (pdf) kick in, will be the worst hit.“Travel & tourism, leisure and hospitality, and automobile sectors have been hit really badly,” said Swetha Harikrishnan, HR director at HackerEarth, a Bengaluru-based talent assessment platform.Quartz takes a look at various sectors that have started to give the pink slips.Endless worries for ITOver 1.5 lakh people across India’s various IT firms\\xa0are expected to lose their jobs in the coming months, as per an April 3 report by Moneycontrol, which cited HR experts. The sector’s reliance on exports to western markets has made it vulnerable.“More than 75% of the industry’s revenues are sourced from exports to large markets like North America and Europe. The spread of coronavirus in these two markets will create ripple effects in the Indian IT industry,” said rating agency CARE in a note on April 14. Indian IT will witness revenue growth of 3-5% in the financial year 2021, compared with 7.7% in FY20, the note added.The smaller firms are already taking a hit.Over 490 IT employees in Bengaluru and West Bengal have lost their jobs so far, according to the Centre of Indian Trade Unions.On March 20, Techolution, a New York-based global technology business consultancy in Hyderabad laid off its 20 employees, citing a market slowdown due to the global coronavirus, as per a report in Huffington Post.However, the larger behemoths may not stay immune. “The bigger firms may not be letting go of their permanent staff as of now, but after two or three months, they will feel the pressure and may not just keep on providing subsidies to the employees,” R Chandrashekhar, a former president of industry body Nasscom, told news agency PTI on April 12.Startups in the same boatIndia’s startup ecosystem is also staring at monstrous losses. Many are instituting layoffs or pay cuts as fears intensify.“The startups that are $10-20-50 million in size have to do cost-cutting. The main cost-cutting in this business is people,” Venture capitalist M Rangaswami told PTI on April 14.On April 13, Ritesh Agarwal, founder and CEO of hospitality major OYO, in a\\xa0video\\xa0message uploaded on YouTube, said that the outbreak of coronavirus has severely impacted travel and tourism. Since the outbreak, OYO’s occupancy rate and revenues have dropped by 50-60% and the company’s balance sheet has come under severe stress, he added.Indian social commerce startup Meesho is reported to have laid off over 200 employees. Besides, over 100 people were asked to leave the\\xa0Bengaluru-based scooter rental startup Bounce. Insurance startup Acko, too, reportedly let go of 45-50 employees.Expecting the worse, on April 10, a number of startup founders, and venture capitalists requested the government to grant them a “robust relief package” to help combat severe impact their business may face due to Covid-19.The startups requested the government to bankroll 50% of their workforce’s salaries for six months, provide interest-free loans, waive rent for three months, and offer tax benefits.MediaMany prominent media houses have sanctioned layoffs or mandatory leave without pay.While The Indian Express and Business Standard newspapers have announced pay cuts, others are also taking steps to curb costs.On April 10, 15 employees of\\xa0 News Nation, a Hindi news national channel,\\xa0were asked to leave with immediate effect. “We have asked to leave citing the slowdown from coronavirus outbreak, there’s a team member who has become a parent of twins recently, his wife is still in the hospital, and at this time when the company was supposed to help, we have been asked not to come to the office,” a senior staff member from the sacked team of News Nation told Quartz.On April 13, digital news website The Quint asked about 45 employees\\xa0to go on indefinite leave without pay. The organisation faced “a truly unprecedented situation…in these circumstances, it is clear that our revenues will be under severe strain over the next 3-4 months,” said an email sent by its HR department to staff, a copy of which Quartz reviewed.Times Life, the Sunday supplement of the Times of India, also asked its employees to leave on April 13.AviationOn April 15, global airlines’ grouping International Air Transport Association (IATA) noted that more than 20 lakh jobs are at risk in India’s aviation sector.“Passenger revenue is expected to fall by more than $8.8 billion and passenger demand decline by 36%,” Albert Tjoeng, assistant director for corporate communications (Asia Pacific) at IATA, said.Some domestic airlines, such as SpiceJet and GoAir, have resorted to leave without pay and layoffs of expat pilots.“The April-June period, traditionally one of the stronger quarters for Indian airlines, is increasingly looking like a washout. This will have implications for July-September (usually the weakest quarter) and for the rest of the financial year 2021,” said Sydney-based Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation (CAPA), in a report published in March-end.Hospitality and tourismTravel restrictions, including in India, are paralysing the hospitality sector too.Seeking financial relief from the government, industry body, the Federation of Hotel & Restaurant Associations of India released a statement on April 15 citing potential job loss. “The hospitality and tourism sector accounts for 12.75% of employment, 5.56% of it is direct and 7.19% indirect. As we speak, the Indian hospitality and tourism industry is staring at a potential job loss of around 38 million, which is 70% of the total workforce, due to Covid-19.”Export sectorThe coronavirus scare has crippled the sector completely. In March, India’s merchandise exports shrunk by a record 34.6%, while imports declined 28.7% as countries sealed their borders to combat the virus.Like the hospitality industry, the export sector, too, is demanding the government to intervene to save it from the massive crisis.Over 1.5 crore people in India could lose their jobs in the wake of gloomy global trade trends due to Covid-19, predicted industry body, Federation of Indian Export Organisation on April 10. The sectors that are heavily dependent on exports are apparel, gems, jewellery, handicrafts, engineering among others.The apparel exports sector alone estimates 2.5-3 million job losses because of order cancellations.What’s next?Despite the horrible situation, experts have found the silver lining.“There are companies that have viewed this as an excellent environment to pick up top talent. They have used this opportunity to think of their post-pandemic recovery and regrowth phase. And technology will be significantly utilised, in this phase and after,” said Vikram Ahuja, co-founder of Talent500 by ANSR, a talent recruiting firm for the IT sector.Experts advise employees with job security to be adaptive to change, and those who’ve lost jobs to make use of the opportunity.“Sacked employees need to be open to re-purposing and up-skilling. This is an opportunity to invest in up-skilling. Be open to freelancing and remote jobs, as there are opportunities there too,” said Harikrishnan. “Unpredictability is high, which also means job opportunities might open up with a big bang in digital in a few months.”\\xa0'}, {'headline': 'OYO’s Aditya Ghosh Invests in UK-based CreditEnable', 'url': 'http://indianweb2.com/2020/04/17/oyos-aditya-ghosh-invests-in-uk-based-creditenable', 'section': 'startup funding', 'body': 'Aditya Ghosh, , OYO (Image - www.businessinsider.in)  Aditya Ghosh, former head of budget carrier Indigo and the board member of hospitality chain Oyo, has invested an undisclosed sum in small business-focused Creditenable.

Courtesy a technological backend, CreditEnable identifies the right lender and right product for each borrower based on their specific business requirements and then does all the work to get them the loan, the statement said. “We are currently in unprecedented times, and small and medium enterprises across the globe are faced with one of the toughest business crisis. The entire process of accessing affordable credit easily and quickly, when SMEs need it, has always been one of the biggest pain points in their business journey,” Ghosh said. Other members on the advisory board include Ishaat Hussain – former Tata Sons CFO, Abhijit Sen – former CFO Citi India, and former executives who have had stints with S&P, Barclays, Citibank, HSBC and JP Morgan, Sun Gard, and other leading global financial services firms, the statement said.

Lightspeed Venture Partners XIII has raised $890 million and will support early-stage companies from seed to Series B rounds, while Lightspeed Venture Partners Select IV, which has a corpus of $1.83 billion, will look to accelerate existing portfolio companies and identify new investments. And, Lightspeed Opportunity Fund, a new fund, will use $1.5 billion to invest in breakout companies across the markets that the multi-stage venture capital firm operates in, including China, India, Israel, Europe and Southeast Asia.“Taken together, this capital framework across three funds will position the firm to continue to serve founding teams, technologies and trends that are accelerating the innovation economy. Lightspeed remains more committed than ever to the mission of serving the world’s most extraordinary people building tomorrow’s companies, today,” the firm said in a statement. Lightspeed, which counts Snap, Guardant Health, AppDynamics, Goop and Nutanix, among its portfolio in the United States, has also been among the most active venture capital investors in India.In Asia’s third-largest economy, Lightspeed India Partners has been an early backer of hospitality chain Oyo Hotels & Hotels, ed-tech unicorn Byju’s and B2B ecommerce marketplace Udaan. All the three Indian portfolio companies are currently valued at $1 billion or more.Additionally, it has also backed regional language-focused social networking and content platform Sharechat, book-keeping startup OKCredit and B2B logistics platform Freight Tiger, among others. In India, the firm has a portfolio strength of 24 companies, according to its website. Lightspeed India has also scored strong partial exits over the last 12 months, earning multi-bagger returns from the part sale of its stakes in Oyo and Byju’s. The firm is estimated to have earned between $900 million and $1 billion from the two transactions. “It is more evident than ever that entrepreneurship is global - 2019 was the first year in venture capital where more breakout companies emerged outside of the US than inside of it,” according to the company statement. The Silicon Valley-based venture capital firm is also reportedly on the road for its third India-focused fund, which has a target corpus of $250-$300 million, and which could close by the end of the June quarter. It had previously raised two India-focused funds - $135 million in 2015, and $175 million in 2018 - having first entered India in 2007 and investing out of the global fund at the time.

This is war time, you have to change everything, Khosla told Business Insider in an interview. Now as in 2008 our prioritization completely changes into an immense focus on protecting the downside and looking after the upside.Click here for more BI Prime stories.Serial entrepreneurship and experience weathering the 2008 downturn have been invaluable to OakNorth cofounder Rishi Khosla.OakNorth loans money to small- and medium-size businesses. It raised $390 million from SoftBank's Vision Fund as part of a wider $440 million round in 2018, one of the biggest funding rounds historically for a UK startup. It has quietly disrupted the $7.9 trillion mid-market lending space.The firm, founded in 2015, is valued at $2.8 billion as a result. It is also profitable, making it a rarity both in the Vision Fund's portfolio and on the wider unicorn scene.As startups struggle for business and funding amid an inevitable, pandemic-related crunch, Khosla says the lessons he learned from during the 2008 global financial crisis are informing leadership decisions now.This is war time, you have to change everything, Khosla said. Now, as in 2008, our prioritization completely changes into an immense focus on protecting the downside and looking after the upside.In 2002, Khosla founded financial research company, Copal Amba, alongside Joel Perlman, his cofounder of OakNorth. Copal Amba was sold to Moody's in 2014.Now Khosla says providing radical transparency to teams and using data to inform decisions are now paying dividends at OakNorth.He cites the company's activity in the US in recent weeks as a key example of its swift adaptation to the current crisis.OakNorth has signed up two new US clients, Customers Bank and Modern Bank, to help expand access to the federal government's Paycheck Protection Programme (PPP). PPP is a new form of financial support from the US federal government which provides funding up to $10 million to businesses with fewer than 500 employees to meet payroll needs.In a 12 day period we went from first hearing about the US government's plans, to working what a tech solution could look like, to winning our first client and then going live with that first client, Khosla said.He added: I believe the strongest entrepreneurs are proven in periods of downturn, you have to see the opportunity and adapt the organization. It has followed a similar blueprint in the UK.The British Business Bank added OakNorth, alongside challenger bank Starling Bank, to its new Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBIL) as an accredited lender this week. CBILs are emergency loans of up to £5 million made in the form of term loans, overdrafts, or invoice and asset finance to small businesses, with lenders receiving government guarantees.ReutersSoftBank Group Corp Chairman and CEO Masayoshi Son speaks during their joint news conference with Toyota Motor Corp President Akio Toyoda in TokyoOakNorth saw a 95% uptick in its pre-tax profits for 2019, to £65.9 million ($82 million), making it one of the few profitable businesses in SoftBank's portfolio. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son recently announced that around 15 of the Vision Fund's 88 portfolio companies would go bust due to coronavirus. Several of the SoftBank-backed businesses in trouble, including hotel chain Oyo, count the Japanese firm as a majority investor, making the pandemic a mutual problem for the companies, but Khosla says that isn't the case at OakNorth. SoftBank is a very valuable investor, but we're not a SoftBank-owned company, he added. We make our own decisions.

The\\nsystems and processes for achieving Phase III timelines of T+3 need to be\\nfurther deliberated and finalised in light of the experience gained during one\\nof the major IPOs that opened and closed in the first week of March 2020,”\\nmentioned the circular.\\n\\nPrior to this, the process involved investors submitting a bid-cum-application\\nform with any intermediary along with bank account details, and movement of\\nsuch application forms from intermediaries to self-certified syndicate banks\\n(SCSBs) for blocking of funds.\\n\\nBy introducing UPI for IPOs, SEBI is looking to reduce the time duration from\\nissue closure to listing from current T+6 to T+3. The process was simple for\\ninvestors. All they needed to do was fill an online application form with\\ndetails like the demat account number, UPI ID, etc. and submit it to the\\nintermediary of the IPO. Once the application is verified, the funds are\\nblocked in the investor’s account via the sponsor bank. All the remaining\\nsteps remain unchanged.\\n\\n“Use of UPI as a payment mechanism with ASBA for public issues through\\nintermediaries will streamline the process of an IPO. It will ultimately\\nenhance the efficiency and oust the call for manual intervention at various\\nstages,” said Sumit Kochar, senior wealth and transaction advisor for Findoc\\nFinancial Services\\n\\n## **UPI Mechanism For IPO Application: The Timeline So Far**\\n\\n  * In November 2018, SEBI proposed UPI as an alternative payment option for retail investors buying shares through IPO.\\n  * Phase 1 began (January 01, 2019 - March 30, 2019). Both UPI and the existing process and existing timeline of T+6 days continued operations in parallel. \\n  * Phase 1 continued for the next three months, till June 30, 2019\\n  * Phase 2 began (July 1, 2019 - September 30, 2019). It was expected that the existing process of physical movement of forms and blocking of funds will be discontinued and only the UPI mechanism with an existing timeline of T+6 days will continue\\n  * In November 2019, Phase 2 extended till March 30, 2020\\n  * In March 2020, Phase 2 extended again until further notice due to Covid-19\\n\\n## **Traditional Vs UPI Mechanism: Pros And Cons**\\n\\nBeing a new process with several stakeholders and technological systems, there\\nare bound to be some bumps along the road. Last year, the IRCTC IPO saw many\\ninvestors irked as they could not participate due to several banks not gearing\\nup for UPI-based applications. There were also glitches in the application\\nmade by minors, HUFs, etc.\\n\\nHowever, barring the initial teething problems where investors were trying to\\nunderstand the basic flow of the process, this is a positive move believe\\nindustry stakeholders such as Groww founder Harsh Jain and Jashan Arora,\\ndirector, Master Capital Services. According to experts, UPI offers a lot of\\nbenefits over the traditional process.\\n\\n  * Investors no longer needed to visit the bank for the IPO application\\n  * The amount remained blocked in their accounts and earned interest too\\n  * The debit occurred only after the allotment\\n  * There was no need to wait for the refund to arrive\\n  * There were no additional charges for this new mechanism\\n  * The mechanism is faster and secure to transfer funds, especially for larger amounts\\n  * While proceeding to invest, the UPI ID can be used for blocking the funds\\n\\n“The platform has seen acceptance and an increase in the adoption rates, given\\nthe number of applications received in ASBA with UPI as a payment mechanism,”\\nadded Arora.\\n\\nKochar shared a different viewpoint here. Historical data suggests that many\\nretail investors are losing faith in UPI due to recent fraudulent activities\\ncausing digital thefts in the account of various investors. The biggest\\nchallenge which SEBI has to tackle is the retail investor’s readiness to use\\ndigitised process.\\n\\nAmid all these challenges, applications made using incorrect UPI handle or\\nusing a bank account of SCSB or a bank not mentioned in the list of UPI\\nenabled bank would pose a bigger problem for the issuer as these applications\\nwill be liable to be rejected.\\n\\n“The same leads to more reluctance and loss of faith from investors on such\\nUPI platforms causing issues to investors and opportunity loss as well,” he\\nadded.\\n\\n## **Impact Of UPI Mechanism On Startups**\\n\\nIn the Indian startup ecosystem, investors do not have a fool-proof exit\\nstrategy. For most investors, mergers and amalgamation have been the best way\\nto exit their portfolio companies. However, in 2018-2019, the number of\\nunicorns in India grew to 30 and many also announced plans for IPOs, including\\nthe likes of Ola, OYO, Freshworks and others\\n\\nBringing the bidding process online and reducing the listing timeline to T+3\\ndays will be a cherry on the cake here, and will encourage more startups to\\ntake the IPO route.\\n\\nWith increasing internet penetration and the busy schedules of millennials,\\nthe online process is expected to ensure an increase in the number of IPO bids\\nas well.\\n\\n“Also, with an increase in UPI transactions, especially after the\\ndemonetisation of Rs.500 and Rs.1000 banknotes, the acceptance of this new\\nmechanism, was easier too,” said Groww’s Jain.\\n\\nIn the current situation, analysts believe that the delay in making UPI the\\ndefault mode would not affect the retail investing for at least next three\\nmonths as the new public issues are not in the pipeline due to the recent\\nbloodbath in the stock market. Retail investors are facing liquidity issues\\ncurrently and are investing cautiously which was seen in the SBI Cards IPO\\nwhich after much anticipation listed below the issue price and is presently\\ntrading close to 33% below list price.'}, {'headline': 'There were things that we did not do well: Ritesh Agarwal ', 'url': 'http://fortuneindia.com/enterprise/there-were-things-that-we-did-not-do-well-ritesh-agarwal/104462', 'section': None, 'body': '\\nThere is nothing about Ritesh Agarwal that lets one on about his status as the founder and CEO of India’s second-most valuable startup , OYO Hotels & Homes. Not his scruffy beard; not his dark jeans and jumper. Fortune India had met him on March 16 at OYO’s Gurugram headquarters, a week before India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day national lockdown to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.The last few months have been tough on the hotel aggregator and its 26-year-old founder. In January, the company went through a round of restructuring, letting go of almost 15%-20% of its workforce in India, and now the spread of the Coronavirus and the subsequent lockdowns in countries around the globe threaten to wipe out a large chunk of its revenue. Earlier this month, the company announced it has seen a 50%-60% fall in revenue and is putting its employees in the U.S. on furloughs.The company has also been facing troubles with hotel partners and fighting a negative impact on the OYO brand, its valuation, and future expansion plans. In an interview with Fortune India, Agarwal explains that the company is trying to make things right. Edited excerpts:Everyone has been saying that OYO has grown too big, too fast. Do you believe it?Did we grow quick? Maybe we did. But only after executing I could know what is the right pace of growth. We learnt it from 2019, and now we are on the path of making sure that we temper it.When I started the business, my aspiration was to set up 10 hotels in my lifetime. You don’t start a company by anticipating or planning. You learn, improve, and move on. I learnt a lot from my management. They are people who are way more educated, experienced, accomplished, and intelligent than I am. My job is to make sure that I set the long-term aspiration and bring in the best leaders to do their job. I love learning new things and executing them.What is the kind of support you have from your investors right now? Will you be raising any funds in the near future?Our shareholders’ view has been very straightforward: There is a business plan that the board has set up, and the management just focussed on delivering that; Don’t get distracted by various things happening outside; Learn as much as you can but focus on delivering results. [We have] no plans right now to raise funds. We have a sizeable balance sheet so the focus now is on delivering results.Our key investors now are SoftBank, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Sequoia Capital, and Airbnb. Smaller shareholders would be Didi Chuxing, Grab, and Sunil Kant Munjal of Hero Enterprise.You had a round of restructuring early this year. What were the reasons for that?There were things last year that we did not do well….anybody who has seen OYO operate over the years will know that this company is of the kind which will acknowledge the problem and fix it. Acknowledging learnings and making decisions are symbols of good companies. We made some restructuring across the board. Wherever we had duplication of workforce we wanted to address that.As we grew into 80 countries, we hired for the same job in many countries because in early days you needed people for those roles. But later technology replaced those jobs in many markets. As a part of our restructuring exercise we had to let go people which is very disappointing. However, we did everything we could for our employees who we had to let go. We gave them extra severance between three months and eight months depending on the roles. Many said we did this for capital management, if so, then we would not have spent so much capital. It was just the right thing for the business to do at that point.You also had trouble with dissatisfied hotel owners who have complained about payment delays and other issues. How are you fixing those?The hotel partners would complain that our sales staff are not aware of our accounting statement. Our business development executives were trained to sell, solve problems, but not fully trained to be an accounts person. To solve that problem, we trained our officers. Now any of our executives can talk about every detailing of sale price, cost price, cost of operating, marginal cost of operating, real estate cost, real estate yield returns. Besides this, we conducted training for many of our staff across different departments such as code of conduct, soft-skill, and behavioural training.You have also launched partner support programmes, Tell us about that?Earlier, our partner support was field-oriented. People in the cities would talk to people on the phone. Now we don’t need that anymore. Earlier, the average turnaround time to solve an issue was seven hours, but now the average turnaround time is 5-6 minutes because it is centralised by means of chat bots or support staff. Today 60% of our partner support queries in the U.S. is now through chat bots. The rest is still done by people on phone calls.When you enter a new market or choose a location no matter how much of data analytics you use you will still get 2%-3% markets wrong. We got certain markets wrong when we chose a location in the past. So we decided not to do any growth investments in those 2%-3% markets and invest in other cities.Next, we looked at governance. [In November, the company announced the appointment of Betsy Atkins, CEO and founder of Baja Corporation, as an independent director on OYO’s board.] Atkins joined as the independent chair of the board. We plan to make disproportionate investments towards building strong corporate governance right from the board to the management to big decisions of the company.In the last three months we have invested in growing up stronger as a healthy child.Talk to us about the future.In the medium-term you will see OYO grow stronger and every growth that OYO brings will lead to incremental bottom line improvements. In India we will continue to back some of the newer businesses that we had launched. But our global focus will become hotels and vacation homes. In India we have much more strength to be able to back all other businesses. For example, the wedding business. It is surprising that the wedding vertical does annually over ₹1,200 crore of sales.(A detailed story on OYO, and more on Ritesh Agarwal’s plans with the company at a time of crisis, will be published in our May issue.)\\n\\n'}, {'headline': 'OYO offers free stay to medical personnel fighting COVID-19', 'url': 'http://clicknow.in/oyo-offers-free-stay-to-medical-personnel-fighting-covid-19', 'section': 'Business', 'body': '  OYO offers free stay to medical personnel fighting COVID-19Hospitality major OYO on Wednesday said that it is opening its hotels for free stay of doctors, nurses and other medical first responders who are helping in the fight against coronavirus in India, starting with select OYO Townhouse hotels in Gurugram and Bengaluru.OYO has rolled out similar initiative offering free accommodation to medical personnel in other international markets including the USA, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Nepal.“Starting with select OYO Townhouse hotels in Gurgaon and Bangalore, medical first responders who are in need of a place to stay and are facing any accommodation issues will receive free accommodations on the display of identification cards,” an OYO statement said.Commenting on the development, Ankit Gupta, Chief Operating Officer & SVP, Frontier Businesses, OYO India and South Asia said: “We at OYO are doing everything possible to ensure the well-being of the healthcare professionals who are our frontline against COVID-19 and it is our duty to support them.

A ByteDance representative didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.New hires around the globe will support the Chinese company’s universe of apps from video platform TikTok to news aggregator Toutiao, while strengthening its operations in new arenas such as e-commerce and gaming. It’s the first salvo of ByteDance’s goal to reach 100,000 staff globally by the end of the year, outlined by Chief Executive Officer Zhang Yiming in an internal memo last month. Once complete, the company will boast roughly the same number of employees as tech giant Alibaba Group.ByteDance is seeking to consolidate its social media strongholds in China and the U.S. while spurring expansions in new markets. Its hiring spree contrasts with other startups, including SoftBank-backed Oyo Hotels & Homes, Zume Pizza and Brandless, that have been cutting jobs or shutting down altogether. As part of the recruitment drive launched last week, ByteDance is seeking to fill more than 100 vacancies in Mountain View -- Google’s home turf -- from a summer software intern to a lead engineer for augmented reality and Apple iOS developer.Like rival Tencent Holdings, ByteDance’s social media channels have seen usage spike after the Covid-19 pandemic confined millions of people to their homes. Now, as life in China begins to return to normal, the employee referral program is looking to find candidates for some 9,900 positions, according to the website viewed by Bloomberg. Just over 1,100 of those openings were for interns as of midday Tuesday.The job listings offer a rare window into how the eight-year-old internet giant is investing in future growth. For example, it’s seeking dozens of online tutors to capture China’s online education boom during the virus outbreak, while acquiring talent for music licensing in places from Miami to Mumbai. The Chinese app factory is also orchestrating forays into gaming, live-streaming commerce and even enterprise software, taking on deeper-pocketed rivals like Tencent and Alibaba.Overall, ByteDance is filling some 3,000 coding, engineering and research roles, and about as many positions in products and operations, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Beyond China, it’s looking to boost headcount by adding more than 100 posts per location in London, Los Angeles, Mountain View and Singapore.The job listings offer a rare window into how the eight-year-old internet giant is investing in future growth.

The world’s largest startup is recruiting people for 10,000 open positions, of which about a third are high-level research or software coding jobs, according to an internal website provided to staff for candidate referrals and shared with Bloomberg. A ByteDance representative didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.  New hires around the globe will support the Chinese company’s universe of apps from video platform TikTok to news aggregator Toutiao, while strengthening its operations in new arenas such as e-commerce and gaming. It’s the first salvo of ByteDance’s goal to reach 100,000 staff globally by the end of the year, outlined by Chief Executive Officer Zhang Yiming in an internal memo last month. Once complete, the company will boast roughly the same number of employees as tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  ByteDance is seeking to consolidate its social media strongholds in China and the U.S. while spurring expansions in new markets. Its hiring spree contrasts with other startups, including SoftBank-backed Oyo Hotels & Homes, Zume Pizza Inc. and Brandless Inc., that have been cutting jobs or shutting down altogether. As part of the recruitment drive launched last week, ByteDance is seeking to fill more than 100 vacancies in Mountain View -- Google’s home turf -- from a summer software intern to a lead engineer for augmented reality and Apple iOS developer.  Like rival Tencent Holdings Ltd, ByteDance’s social media channels have seen usage spike after the Covid-19 pandemic confined millions of people to their homes. Now, as life in China begins to return to normal, the employee referral program is looking to find candidates for some 9,900 positions, according to the website viewed by Bloomberg. Just over 1,100 of those openings were for interns as of midday Tuesday.  The job listings offer a rare window into how the eight-year-old internet giant is investing in future growth. For example, it’s seeking dozens of online tutors to capture China’s online education boom during the virus outbreak, while acquiring talent for music licensing in places from Miami to Mumbai. The Chinese app factory is also orchestrating forays into gaming, live-streaming commerce and even enterprise software, taking on deeper-pocketed rivals like Tencent and Alibaba.  Overall, ByteDance is filling some 3,000 coding, engineering and research roles, and about as many positions in products and operations, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Beyond China, it’s looking to boost headcount by adding more than 100 posts per location in London, Los Angeles, Mountain View and Singapore.

That shift of technology in America created a substantial business transformation, moving from manufacturing to the services sector in India. During that time, the Indian economy had reported more than 7 per cent growth due to the information technology sector.Similarly, in the last 6-7 years, India witnessed a market momentum in the direction of start-up businesses. These start-up ventures were successful in attracting young, intellectual human capital from eminent institutes. However, the seed capital is collected from angel investors and high net worth individuals. Further, the next round of capital was raised predominantly from the global venture capital firms. Also, the Central and State governments are extending their support to build an eco-friendly system for setting up start-ups, to achieve the dream of ‘Make in India’.Guidance neededManaging such start-up businesses is quite challenging under the current turbulent market conditions. Most of the start-ups are primarily set up by youngsters, and they need mentors and gurus to guide them at this taxing hour. The success story of services businesses in the beginning of 21st Century in India, was predominantly an extension of family-owned enterprises that emerged as global companies, like the Ambanis, Tatas, Birlas, and Hindujas etc. During that period, hand-holding was a significant factor in running family businesses. So there is a necessity for the same kind of hand-holding even now, apart from experience, age and financials, for the survival of start-up ventures in the present times.We should remember that start-ups cannot be successful without carrying forward innovation, research and development. Statistics show that more than 80 per cent of start-up ventures are in the services sector, providing either e-services or m-services or both, using smartphones. Also, most young managers are finding it easy to set up businesses and earn quick money at a young age. This was not the objective of 20th Century companies. The 21st Century managers are encashing on the start-up boom, which could actually turn out be a bubble, due to the Covid-19 pandemic now.Financing woesAlso, well-known Indian unicorn start-ups were able to avail financing from global players. For example, Tencent, Alibaba, Soft Bank, Ant Financials and DidiChuxing, which are the major Chinese and Japanese venture capital firms, invested in significant start-ups like OYO rooms, Ola, and Byju’s etc. On the other hand, a large number of Indian start-ups are still finding it difficult to procure funds. Indian venture capital firms like Sequoia Capital India, Blume Ventures, Accel Partners, etc have invested aggressively in some of such start-ups.\\n\\n\\xa0But now, due to Covid-19, many Chinese VC firms will be under severe pressure to raise finances. Also, investments from Japan, Korea and the US VC firms will hit Indian start-ups because of the present market crash and bear run in the capital markets. If the ongoing turmoil and uncertainty in global financial markets continues, it can terribly ruin the journey of start-ups.As a consequence, many start-ups will focus on cost reduction and bring in cost efficiencies. As of now, the advertising and promotional expenses incurred by Paytm stand at ₹2,224.9 crore in FY18 and ₹3,451.4 crore in FY19, which show a 55 per cent rise in advertising expenditure in just one year. Similarly, PhonePe incurred ad expenses of ₹602.3 crore in FY18 and ₹1,296 crore in FY19, which is a rise of more than 100 per cent. Now the same start-ups will cut spending on advertisements and employee costs as well.On the other end, valuation experts believe too much of uncertainty is not suitable for an economy. They also say valuing start-ups in such a situation would be very difficult and may even result in undervaluation of start-up ventures. This will lead to underperformance of VC firms.This has been evident in the past; few reputed VC firms approached investment banking companies to protect their financials and also to mitigate their risks. Thus, the future of start-ups will be in the hands of VC firms, and to preserve their financials, there will be mergers and acquisitions on this front.Finally, recession markets create challenges, as seen in 2008-2009; surprisingly, these were birth years of successful global start-ups like Uber, Flipkart, Airbnb and WhatsApp. Hence the trick is to believe in your innovations and update your business models to sustain this pandemic crisis.The writer is Assistant Professor, Institute of Public Enterprise, Hyderabad\\n\\n'}, {'headline': \"TikTok's parent, ByteDance, launches global hiring spree with 10,000 new jobs\", 'url': 'http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/tiktoks-parent-bytedance-launches-global-hiring-spree-with-10000-new-jobs/articleshow/75151513.cms', 'section': 'Small Biz', 'body': 'By Zheping Huang ByteDance Inc. just kicked off a wave of hiring it envisions hitting 40,000 new jobs in 2020, hoping to match Alibaba’s headcount at a time technology corporations across the globe are furloughing or reducing staff.

But in reality, instead of allowing clients to pay just 30%, WeWork is offering to give a credit equivalent of 70% to their existing contracts.This means that customers will have to continue paying the entire rent each month even though they are not using the space. At the end of the lockdown, WeWork will add extra days to their existing contracts equivalent to 70% of the rent for the days its offices remain shut.“I need to save my money today, not a few months later,” Subho Halder, co-founder and chief information security officer of mobile app security testing startup AppKnox, told Quartz. “Who knows if a company may survive or may not survive until then.”When AppKnox moved into WeWork in November 2018, it was among the most expensive shared working spaces in Bengaluru. “But we didn’t care, we were getting revenues and could spend,” said Haldar. AppKnox pays Rs3 lakh ($3,924) per month—nearly 15% of its total expenditure—as rent for its 16-member team to operate from WeWork’s Bengaluru facility.Lately, the six-year-old company has seen a drop in its revenue as some of its clients have suspended services in the wake of the pandemic. AppKnox’s senior management has taken salary cuts to stay afloat, and continuing to pay WeWork’s rental could cost them dearly.On its part, WeWork said it could not offer a rent waiver because it is still bearing operational costs, including paying on-site employees, partners, and contract workers. “Our buildings are being sanitised regularly and have been repurposed to prioritise safety and health once we reopen,” a WeWork spokesperson told Quartz. The company said it is working with small businesses and startups faced with unprecedented economic challenges on a case-by-case basis.When AppKnox’s co-founders reached out to WeWork to explain their situation, the co-working major offered to waive off just Rs7,500 monthly parking charges and not a penny more, Agarwal’s correspondence with the company show.WeWork, an industry leader with\\xa0over 35,000 members across India, could set a bad example for\\xa0the entire co-working community in India, experts said.“Those with deeper pockets ought to take deeper responsibility in such a grave situation,” said Sanchit Vir Gogia, founder of advisory firm Greyhound Research, who also operates from one of WeWork’s Gurugram offices, paying Rs21,000 plus tax per head for his team.Force majeure or notSome of WeWork’s rivals are handling the situation in a far better way so far. For instance, on the day of the lockdown announcement (March 24), 91Springboard’s CEO Anand Vemuri sent a letter to its members saying it was declaring Covid-19 a “force majeure” event, waiving off fees until the end of the lockdown and allowing contract terminations without resistance.BHIVE Workspace, another Bengaluru-based co-working space, has also relaxed the rules. A client, image and video processing and delivery company Gumlet, moved its employees to remote work on March 16, even before the official lockdown. “Since we are not going to use the office for quite some time, we reached out to BHIVE and they agreed to give us a concession for two months,” co-founder and CEO Aditya Patadia said. “This was a very kind gesture by them. If this lockdown continues, we can trust our workspace provider for their support.”But here’s what WeWork told AppKnox when they demanded a rent waiver:WeWork is not liable on account of, any delay or failure to perform its obligations as required by the Agreement as a result of any causes or conditions that are beyond WeWork’s reasonable control and the existence of a force majeure event does not give rise to any termination event.“Bigger players may play hardball and stick to their guns largely because of their own funding constraints,” said Prashant Thakur, director and head of research at ANAROCK Property Consultants. “However, smaller coworking players recognise the current situation as an opportunity to attract customers by virtue of better flexibility as well as cost arbitrage.”Of course, some smaller players have also started taking from the market leader.The founder of a New-Delhi based tech startup, who did not wish to be identified, said Oyo-owned Innov8 co-working space is also asking for full rent payout for April, which it says will be returned in the form of discounts in the months of May, June, and July. Innov8 is also not allowing its clients to terminate contracts.WeWork’s conundrumThe coronavirus breakout could not have come at a worse time for WeWork.Once valued at a staggering $47 billion, the unicorn is now strapped for cash. It posted a $1.25 billion loss in the third quarter of 2019 and has been laying off staff globally.The Softbank-backed company’s reputation has taken a solid beating during the coronavirus outbreak across\\xa0in the US, too, as it is keeping its offices running by claiming to serve “essential services.” In fact, in the US, WeWork is\\xa0even raising rents for some tenants, and charging an annual fee that it can bill at any time during a year at its discretion.Thousands of tenants have stopped payments and threatened legal action. Ironically, WeWork itself has skipped paying rents in some US locations because of the poor business conditions.“WeWork has a lot to lose. Their scale of payouts is unimaginable. You cannot compare it to an Innov8 or 91springboard,” Gogia of Greyhound said.The best WeWork can do at this time is to go back to landlords and renegotiate rentals, experts say.“With a business model like a co-working space, the impact is similar to running a retail outlet. While our current clientele is intact with us, we have witnessed lesser engagement with new companies,” Akshita Gupta, co-founder and chief marketing officer at ABL Workspaces, said. “We will only be able to pass on the rebates once we get it either from our landlords or from the government.”'}, {'headline': 'Lightspeed Venture raises over $4B to fund early and growth-stage entrepreneurs amid coronavirus ', 'url': 'http://yourstory.com/2020/04/lightspeed-venture-fund-early-growth-stage-entrepreneurs', 'section': 'News', 'body': 'Lightspeed Venture Partners has raised over $4 billion for three new funds to support early and growth-stage entrepreneurs across the world.According to a statement, the California-based venture capital firm closed the\\xa0Lightspeed Venture Partners XIII, L.P. with $890 million, Lightspeed Venture Partners Select IV, L.P. with $1.83 billion, and Lightspeed Opportunity Fund, L.P.

Naik. His father, Manibhai Naik, who was the principal of a school in a village in South Gujarat, had devoted his life to upliftment of poor children. His grandfather, too, was a school principal and a social worker. The engineer, who headed Indias largest engineering and technology company for over two decades, decided to donate 75 per cent of his income to social causes.In 1995, when Naik was a mid-level manager with L&T, his father had requested him to arrange some additional beds and facilities for a hospital in the village of Kharel, Gujarat. Instead of using his corporate connections, Naik dipped into his personal savings and provident fund to offer Rs 4 lakh.It was about 15 years later, in 2009, when Naik set up two trusts - the Nirali Memorial Medical Trust (NMMT; named after his grand-daughter Nirali who passed away at the age of two) for healthcare, and the AM Naik Charitable Trust for education and skill-building. \"When we lost her to cancer, my family and I decided to turn our personal tragedy into a step that would benefit thousands of Niralis around the country.\"NMMTs early projects included setting up an advanced radiation centre in Surat (inset photo), and mobile clinics. A couple of years ago, it set up a multi-diagnostic centre in Powai, Mumbai. The Trust is now setting up a healthcare campus at Navsari near Surat. It will have an advanced cancer hospital that will be run in collaboration with Tata Trusts, and will have facilities to offer close to 16,000 sessions of radiotherapy, 630 patient surgeries and 5,000 cycles of chemotherapy. The campus will have a 300-bed multi-specialty hospital as well that will be run by the Apollo Group. \"Whatever service or facility we offer, we must be as good as the best in the world,\" says Naik.Naik and his family directly head the Trusts activities. In this he has the active support of his children, who are settled in the US. \"In the final analysis, a society and a community is going to be judged not by how greatly it helps the wealthy and the powerful but how effectively it responds to the needs of the vulnerable and the marginalised.\"- PB JayakumarThe Hard HitterLike a true-blue Indian, Indra Nooyi, former CEO of PepsiCo, had always been in love with cricket. While she is not known for her career in cricket, Nooyi\\'s passion for the sport is well-documented. She was determined to start the first women\\'s cricket team at the Madras Christian College. It was 1971 and eyebrows were raised but a resolute Nooyi got her way. Once her college started its women\\'s cricket team, others followed suit.The seam bowler took some valuable lessons from the pitch to the board room. Nooyi believes that the game showed her how to put her team first.However, when she moved to the US in the late 70s, she could not pursue her passion. So she adapted and found a different pitch - baseball.In 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) appointed Nooyi as the first independent female director. \"I love the game of cricket. I played it as a teenager and in college, and to this day, I cherish the lessons the game taught me about teamwork, integrity, respect, and healthy competition,\" she said.- Anwesha MadhukalyaWords of WisdomAs a child, Sandeep Lodha, CEO of Oyo-owned Weddingz.in, was not into reading. His love for books started only after he started working. \"A friend suggested that I read Shoe Dog by Phil Knight when I was toiling to set up my start-up. The book, which talks about how Knight created Nike, helped me deal with the stress. The book taught me how to ride through the initial challenges such as family pressure and rejection from investors,\" says Lodha.Now, books on entrepreneurship - The Airbnb Story by Leigh Gallagher; Alibaba: The House That Jack Ma Built by Duncan Clark to Cold Steel by Tim Bouquet and Byron Ousey - keep Lodha motivated. \"In 2016, we were a hand-to-mouth start-up. When demonetisation happened, we felt our business would shut, but we survived. In difficult times like these I look up to books and find ways to sail through,\" he says.The spread of coronavirus yet again poses a challenge, but Lodha is in high spirits. His guiding light is the book on Alibaba by Clark, which talks of how Jack Ma made it through the SARS outbreak in China and the companys headquarters being quarantined right before the launch of e-commerce platform Taobao. \"It\\'s survival of the fittest. This is the time to be creative and evolve. Build a new business model so that once the lockdown opens, you emerge stronger and sharper,\" Lodha advises.- Aprajita Sharma'}, {'headline': 'Building on Corona', 'url': 'http://businesstoday.in/magazine/cover-story/building-on-corona/story/401042.html', 'section': None, 'body': 'Unusual misfortunes create unexpected business opportunities. R.C. Mansuhkani, Chairman of Man Industries - which makes special steel pipes for oil & gas and hydrocarbon sectors, is keen to restart his factory at Anjar in Kutch, Gujarat. So far, Corona has not reached Kutch. The 2,000-plus workforce, mostly migrant workers, is idling in dwellings provided by the company. This Rs 2,200 crore-plus company, the largest supplier of such specialised pipes, has a near Rs 2,000-crore order book, half of which is for exports. Raw material (steel) prices are cooling and supplies, even from China, Japan and South Korea, have not been hit so far. Crude oil prices are also falling and his clients like IOC, BPCL, ONGC and oil exploration and production companies abroad are unlikely to freeze refinery expansion or repair work. \"There can be only two-three week delay in supplies. I don\\'t see many issues for us in both near and long term, compared to many other sectors,\" says Mansuhkani, who is worrying more about high working capital loan rates that can negate his competitiveness on a global level.Mansuhkhani is raring to go post-lockdown and so are several of India\\'s healthcare, pharmaceuticals, FMCG, vaccine, chemicals, hospitality and IT companies, which are gearing up to turn the capabilities acquired during the coronavirus crisis into new businesses in India and abroad.The post-coronavirus future will be defined by greater localisation of supply chains, backward integration, faster policy decisions, increase in digital capabilities and investments in enabling technologies such as cloud, data and cyber security. Focus will be on cutting business costs, including fixed costs, increasing outsourcing, reducing manpower, bringing down non-core manufacturing and supply chain re-alignments, say experts.There will be many gainers from this crisis, apart from the prime and obvious candidates like our healthcare and biomedical sector. Before exploring the opportunities in health, let\\'s look at other sectors like FMCG, IT, petrochemical and textiles that are facing the brunt of this disruption but have been able to identify opportunities, too.E-tail and ManufacturingWith supply chains broken during lockdown, FMCG majors Marico and Britannia teamed up with delivery platforms such as Swiggy, Zomato and Dunzo to distribute products being churned out by their plants. Flipkart and BigBasket partnered with cab aggregators such as Uber for delivery. Many retailers are also partnering with third-party supply chain companies like ShopX, Udaan, StoreKing and Jumbotail. \"We are looking at third-party supply chain companies which have a strong digital backbone,\" says Unibic CEO Srini Vudayagiri.These new relationships are unlikely to snap post lockdown. They have stood the test of a crisis and have proven their effectiveness. They are projected to evolve into new business partnerships when lockdown opens.Market research firm Neilson says life after Covid-19 will be \"a new normal\" and FMCG companies and online retailers will be among the major gainers. FMCG firms are re-inventing themselves for the future with new supply chain strategies and unconventional delivery models. This may be temporary for some but everybody agrees these models will gain prominence.\"E-commerce companies have to re-look at last-mile deliveries and reinvent current operating models and route to the customer, apart from how they buffer their stock. The entire operating model will change,\" says Easwaran P.S., Lead, Supply Chain Solutions, Deloitte India. The companies will explore newer \"direct to consumer\" channels. The ability to predict and manage demand will be a game-changer.While Bata India CEO Sandeep Kataria says one can\\'t really predict the future at this point, Arvind Mediratta, CEO, Metro Cash & Carry, says: \"Digitisation earlier was a nice-to-do thing, but now it\\'s becoming a must.\"The e-commerce market in India is forecast to grow from about $64 billion in 2020 to about $200 billion by 2024. The post-coronavirus scenario and new business models can accelerate this growth.IT and TelemedicineSometimes, all it needs is a push and a shove for an industry to boom. Just as Paytm took off after the DeMo crisis, doctor consultations online may just become acceptable following the lockdown. So, healthcare aggregators like Ratan Tata-funded Lybrate and HealthAssure are leaving no stone unturned to make the most of this. They have launched new packages and innovations in the wake of the virus scare. Lockdown may have unravelled the true potential of \"Telemedicine\"as the number of people going to outpatient departments of hospitals will diminish.\"Every industry has to find ways to digitally engage with customers and employees,\" says Rob Thomas, General Manager, IBM Data & AI, which is helping numerous industries worldwide with its AI platforms for data analysis and communication. CISCO India & SAARC President Sameer Garde says many new technology-enabled businesses are emerging. These include telemedicine, online education and virtual conferences and meetings. \"The current circumstances are bringing a lot of new technologies like analytics, AI, robotics, drones, AR/VR to the forefront. We can expect their adoption to accelerate,\" he says.A McKinsey report says India could save up to $10 billion by 2025 if telemedicine replaces 30-40 per cent of in-person outpatient consultations. Banking on opportunities in the medical tourism segment, corporates like Apollo Hospitals are experimenting with business models combining telemedicine, hospitals and hospitality. A few days ago, Apollo Hospitals Group launched a partnership model to help quarantined patients stay at hotel rooms with telemedicine treatment support from Apollo. The partners are Hindustan Unilever, State Bank of India, Oyo Rooms, Lemon Tree, Ginger Hotels and Zomato. Already, private healthcare is popularising the concept of key-hole surgeries and daycare surgical centres for minor procedures, so that they can improve their Average Revenue Per Occupied Bed.There will be a host of changes in customer behaviour, too, say experts. Sanitation, self-hygiene, immunity, wellness and biowaste disposal are some businesses that will indirectly get a fillip. A good number of people may avoid crowds and shop and order food online. \"Fears related to social distancing are there to stay for some time, and we are looking at models like home delivery and e-tailing to improve sale of spirits,\" says Amrit Kiran Singh, Chairman of the International Spirits & Wines Association of India. India consumes about 350 million cases of spirits and 10 million cases of wine, but consumption out of bars and restaurants is only 25 per cent. In the developed world, it is 50 per cent.Bright for PetrochemicalsIndia is the sixth-largest chemical and petrochemical producer in the world. With crude oil prices falling, petrochemical prices are likely to remain low in the medium to long term. Given that China accounts for a third of global petrochemical capacity, many producers are expected to have large inventories, which will also drive down prices. \"Most fundamental factors for growth and investments still hold in India - high population with increasing per capita demand for chemicals, shift to Asia as a manufacturing hub, increasing purchasing power and availability of labour. The only question mark is the timing of the recovery in economic activity,\" says a recent KPMG report on Covid-19 impact.India\\'s pharmaceutical sector, which supplies 20 per cent medicines and one in every three tablets sold across the globe, is going to be a main gainer from this crisis. But a major worry is dependence on China for over 70-80 per cent of the main active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and their intermediates. So, while the world is looking at India to supply Hydroxychloroquine, an old malaria medicine that can be effective in Covid-19 treatment, India has only two integrated manufacturers (Zydus Cadila and Ipca Laboratories) of this drug. \"If I want to start an API plant in India, it requires at least one-and-a-half years, and getting environmental clearances is a big issue, whereas in China, you get all clearances quickly, apart from capital and other support infrastructure,\" says Arjun Juneja, Joint Managing Director, Mankind Pharma.Corona causes world to look at Indian pharma for relief Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an old pharmaceutical molecule, was invented by German multinational Bayer in the 1940s. Most multinationals stopped its production decades back as malaria is no longer prevalent in most developed nations.India, however makes 80-85 per cent of finished formulations of HCQ, including combination drugs. Majorities are exported to 70-80 countries. It is not a big market, though. India\\'s exports of HCQ in FY19 were only $51 million and the whole current size of the US market is only $220 million. Zydus Cadila is the largest player in the US market with 32 per cent market share by volume and the top 10 players include Dr. Reddy\\'s Lab (10%) and Sun Pharma (7%).HCQ suddenly gained prominence as some studies found it has strong antiviral effects on the coronavirus infection, which neither has a drug nor a vaccine. This prompted US President Donald Trump to direct the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to do away with rigid laws to ensure possible treatments for Covid-19.Like Zydus, Mumbai-based Ipca Laboratories is a large integrated maker of HCQ and supplies across the world, except to the US. That was because its API unit at Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh and two formulation facilities were banned for almost five years by the USFDA citing sub-standard quality manufacturing. After Trump\\'\\'s directive, the FDA has given temporary clearance for all these units to facilitate export to the US.Another leading Indian respiratory drug maker Cipla was given fast-track permission this week by the USFDA to sell Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Aerosol. Cipla\\'s drug is first-generic of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp\\'s Proventil, used to treat severe chest congestion with asthma symptoms, which has a US market of $2.8 billion. Analysts were expecting approval for Cipla\\'s product only by FY21 and limited sales during the year. Now they estimate FY22 sales of $50-60 million from the product, an inhaler with the medicine. Another Indian drug maker Lupin also has a filing for Albuterol in the US and is expecting a similar fast-track approval.But coronavirus has triggered a small change for the better. The government has announced development of three \"Bulk Drug Parks\" with financial investment of Rs 3,000 crore in the next five years and Rs 6,940 crore incentives for the next eight years for making critical Key Starting Material (KSM), intermediates and APIs in India. \"About 8-10 drug intermediates and KSMs currently imported from China to the tune of 15,000 tonnes have been identified for use in Covid-19 treatment and we can work with the industry to indigenise them,\" says Ashwini Kumar Nangia, Director, CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory, Pune.A related sector - technical textiles - is also going to gain, just like domestic manmade yarns and fabrics used in special application apparel like personal protection equipment (PPE). For India\\'s textile and apparel sector, which contributes 2 per cent to GDP and employs 45 million, prices of imported manmade fibre-based high-value products are expected to rise at least 25-30 per cent over the next two quarters due to slowdown in China. Besides, apparel production will shrink by 18-20 per cent and yarn production by 12-15 per cent during the next six months, says the KPMG report. It also says that for the real estate sector, which is going to face a severe impact due to lack of demand and capital, demand for industrial (logistics and warehousing) construction and data centres is likely to lead to a strong recovery in future. \"If global manufacturing giants shift some capacity from China to India, aided by favourable government policies, it could lead to some construction demand in the manufacturing sector. Long-term outlook for the commercial real estate sector also remains good,\" says Subodh C. Dixit, Executive Director (Engineering and Construction), Shapoorji Pallonji.Make-in-India Future for Medical DevicesThe crisis has given a lease of life to Indian medical device manufacturers, who are mostly in the MSME sector. \"Many of these big companies that have partnered with medical device makers are going to stay back as partners as there is a business opportunity in future. They can not only bring capital to compete with multinationals but also create scale, big basket of products, technological expertise and quality standards for global competition,\" says Rajiv Nath, Forum Coordinator, Association of Indian Medical Device Industry; and Managing Director of Hindustan Syringes & Medical Devices.A part of the Make-in-India initiative is focused on plans to catapult India to among the top five medical devices manufacturing hubs in the world. At present, 75-80 per cent of the Rs 1,05,000-crore fragmented medical device industry in India is dominated by multinationals such as GE, J&J, Philips, Wipro, Abbott, Siemens, Baxtar and Fresenius. There are just four domestic manufacturers - Trivitron, Transasia Biomedicals, Hindustan Syringes & Medical Devices and PolyMedicure - with over Rs 500 crore revenues a year.\"Other than announcement of medical parks and small incentives, we never got a level-playing field. Almost all the policies or major tenders so far were in their favour and even big hospitals and procurers in India neglected the domestic manufacturers. Those MNCs are not in a position to manufacture for India as they are busy managing crisis in their respective home countries,\"says G.S.K. Velu, Chairman and Managing Director, Trivitron - India\\'s largest medical devices maker.\"Instead of a paltry Rs 1-2 crore grant, we require Rs\\xa0 50-100 crore grants and incentives for research and also collaborations with institutions like IITs having precision engineering knowledge and talent,\" says Velu.Public Health and BiotechnologyExperts say the pandemic will lead to increased public pressure to invest more in health infrastructure, especially primary and secondary care. A Motilal Oswal research report says the Indian government\\'s health expenditure as percentage to GDP has remained at 1-1.5 per cent, whereas the world average is 7.4 per cent. Similarly, India has one of the least number of doctors per 1,000 population. \"India had, over decades, ignored fundamentals like strengthening primary healthcare, producing adequate doctors and setting up public sector hospitals and related infrastructure,\" says Muralidharan Nair, a public health expert and Partner and Leader (Health) at EY India. \"The old system of primary care and secondary care is broken and needs to be restored,\" says R.B. Smarta, Chairman and Managing Director, Interlink, which advises life science companies.India also has an opportunity in the biotechnology sector, say experts. But lack of biotech infrastructure is a big issue. For example, Serum has been able to develop a vaccine candidate for coronavirus, but is not sure if it can make that in India. \"This (vaccine candidate) will have to be handled under BSL 3 (biosafety level) conditions, which is basically a very high containment level, and I don\\'t know how many facilities in the world have high volume manufacturing in BSL 3. Even if you have the vaccine, the main challenge will be to manufacture it in large volumes,\" says Adar Poonawala, CEO, Serum Institute of India.India will also have to develop a scientific community that can market its IPs, encourage entrepreneur-scientists and create infrastructure to make India a power house in the biomedical sector, Kiran Majumdar Shah, Founder and Chairperson, Biocon, has written in a blog.Muralidharan Nair says the Indian pharma industry should focus on developing new molecules rather than using chemistry skills to make copycat generic drugs for short-term profits. \"With bioengineering and advanced computing coming together, synthetic biology is going to have wide applications in infectious diseases, agriculture, water, air. This is the time to be in biotech,\" says Ashok Trivedi, Founder and Trustee, Ashoka University; and Managing Partner of SWAT Capital, who will invest Rs 100 crore to launch Trivedi School of Biosciences with focus on synthetic biology, data science, biodiversity and ecology.The post-coronavirus phase might be a new dawn for several large chunks of India Inc, it seems. @pb_pbjayan'}, {'headline': \"TikTok's parent, ByteDance, launches global hiring spree with 10,000 new jobs\", 'url': 'http://tech.economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/tiktoks-parent-bytedance-launches-global-hiring-spree-with-10000-new-jobs/articleshow/75151513.cms', 'section': 'Small Biz', 'body': 'By Zheping Huang ByteDance Inc. just kicked off a wave of hiring it envisions hitting 40,000 new jobs in 2020, hoping to match Alibaba’s headcount at a time technology corporations across the globe are furloughing or reducing staff.  The world’s largest startup is recruiting people for 10,000 open positions, of which about a third are high-level research or software coding jobs, according to an internal website provided to staff for candidate referrals and shared with Bloomberg. A ByteDance representative didn’t respond to an emailed request for comment.  New hires around the globe will support the Chinese company’s universe of apps from video platform TikTok to news aggregator Toutiao, while strengthening its operations in new arenas such as e-commerce and gaming. It’s the first salvo of ByteDance’s goal to reach 100,000 staff globally by the end of the year, outlined by Chief Executive Officer Zhang Yiming in an internal memo last month. Once complete, the company will boast roughly the same number of employees as tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.  ByteDance is seeking to consolidate its social media strongholds in China and the U.S. while spurring expansions in new markets. Its hiring spree contrasts with other startups, including SoftBank-backed Oyo Hotels & Homes, Zume Pizza Inc. and Brandless Inc., that have been cutting jobs or shutting down altogether. As part of the recruitment drive launched last week, ByteDance is seeking to fill more than 100 vacancies in Mountain View -- Google’s home turf -- from a summer software intern to a lead engineer for augmented reality and Apple iOS developer.  Like rival Tencent Holdings Ltd, ByteDance’s social media channels have seen usage spike after the Covid-19 pandemic confined millions of people to their homes. Now, as life in China begins to return to normal, the employee referral program is looking to find candidates for some 9,900 positions, according to the website viewed by Bloomberg. Just over 1,100 of those openings were for interns as of midday Tuesday.  The job listings offer a rare window into how the eight-year-old internet giant is investing in future growth. For example, it’s seeking dozens of online tutors to capture China’s online education boom during the virus outbreak, while acquiring talent for music licensing in places from Miami to Mumbai. The Chinese app factory is also orchestrating forays into gaming, live-streaming commerce and even enterprise software, taking on deeper-pocketed rivals like Tencent and Alibaba.  Overall, ByteDance is filling some 3,000 coding, engineering and research roles, and about as many positions in products and operations, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Beyond China, it’s looking to boost headcount by adding more than 100 posts per location in London, Los Angeles, Mountain View and Singapore.

It was not immediately clear how many hotel contracts Oyo plans to end nor in which countries, said the sources, who asked not to be named as the discussions were still private.  Oyo did not respond to an email seeking comment.  Oyo will prioritise business and investment in India, Southeast Asia, Europe, China and the United States while sustaining a presence in places like Japan, Brazil, Mexico and the Middle East, said the fourth source.  The company has $1 billion of cash and the measures, along with other cost-cutting initiatives and furloughs outlined in early April, are aimed at reducing monthly expenses to about $25 million by June from $40 million, the source added.  Other large hotel operators like Marriott International  have also abandoned their financial outlooks and furloughed staff to conserve cash.  On April 8, Oyo\\'s founder Ritesh Agarwal, said the pandemic had resulted in a 50%-60% drop in revenues and occupancy levels, putting \"severe stress\" on the company\\'s balance sheet.  \"Given how unprecedented the current situation is, it\\'s natural for Oyo to prepare for the worst,\" said one of the three people cited above.  >HEADY EXPANSION>  Oyo is one of SoftBank\\'s biggest bets with the Japanese group holding a 46% stake.  The six-year-old hotel startup had already consulted turnaround specialist Alvarez & Marsal and Accenture Plc  last year, two of the four people said, and more recently it tapped human resources advisor Aon Hewitt.  Alvarez and Accenture did not respond to emails seeking comment. Aon Hewitt declined to comment.  Between January and March, Oyo cut 5,000 jobs mainly in China and India, leaving it with about 25,000 employees, and amended contracts with hotels to remove revenue guarantees.  It also decided to end contracts with hotels that did not generate annual revenues of at least $100,000, the two sources said. Emerging markets like India, Southeast Asia and Latin America bore the brunt of the cuts, one of the two people said, adding that Oyo now operated in 400 Indian cities from 550 previously.  The measures helped Oyo halve its monthly costs to $40 million from $80 million in January, said the two people.'}, {'headline': 'Softbank-backed OYO to Cut Pay of All Employees in India as Lockdown Brings Travel to a Halt', 'url': 'http://news18.com/news/business/softbank-backed-oyo-to-cut-pay-of-all-employees-in-india-as-lockdown-brings-travel-to-a-halt-2587853.html', 'section': 'Business', 'body': 'New Delhi: Softbank Group-backed OYO Hotels and Homes has cut the salaries of all employees by 25% for four months starting April and also sent some of its people on leave with limited benefits, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.

SoftBank’s Vision Fund initially put around $250 million into Oyo, and later led a further $1 billion funding round that pushed its valuation to $5 billion, Bloomberg News reported. With Agarwal, the SoftBank founder even went a step further. He backed a $2 billion loan to let the 25-year old buy back shares in Oyo, driving the value to $10 billion — with the added effect of boosting the Vision Fund’s paper profits. Son probably preferred that the stake, bought from earlier backers, land in the hands of the Indian entrepreneur than a rival investor. But now those huge bets are starting to unravel. SoftBank late Monday said it expects to record an investment loss of 1.8 trillion yen at the Vision Fund for the year ended March 31. That translates to about $16.6 billion, and takes a sizable chunk out of the $100 billion fund. The company will take a further 800 billion yen loss on investments outside the fund, including writedowns on WeWork and WorldVu Satellites, better known as OneWeb.Read: Virus-hit Oyo puts Masayoshi Son's $2 billion guarantee at riskOyo is just one victim of this SoftBank-fueled roller-coaster, which accelerated when the Covid-19 pandemic started to spread. The Indian startup has furloughed staff in a bid to save cash, and founder Agarwal’s shares could be in jeopardy if he faces margin calls. Son’s insistence that startups grow faster than their founders planned, and strong-arm them into taking more money than they might have wanted, has turned into a burden. And that’s become a huge liability to investors in the Vision Fund and SoftBank, too.By throwing cash around, dozens of startups became addicted to spending instead of building fiscal discipline into their business models. For years, it seemed like a sound strategy. By having more money than rivals, SoftBank-backed companies could win market share by offering bigger incentives, taking out more ads and luring the best talent.Today, SoftBank has a major stake in sector leaders like Uber, WeWork, Grab and Oyo. But climbing to number one doesn’t mean being profitable.It’s easy to blame the venture capital model itself. The whole point of this founding pile of cash is to tide a business over until it finds a working model that’s sustainable. And in starting the Vision Fund with a $100 billion endowment, Son wanted to be the Godfather of venture capitalists.But a good VC shouldn’t just be a loud cheerleader for its portfolio companies; it’s also the wise old voice of reason when founders’ success gets to their head. Savvy VCs can advise when to pivot, when to kill products and when to sell out to a rival. Instead, the Vision Fund acts more like the loud soccer mom, intent on letting the world know that her kid is best on field and screaming at the coach when the child gets benched.Just as Son has been the enabler of fiscally dubious business models, investors in SoftBank and the Vision Fund have been enablers of the founder’s recklessness. For over a decade, Son has been dining out on his winning bet on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., with few detractors brave enough to poke a stick at the pile of debt he’s built up along the way to buy telcos and internet companies.It’s perhaps no surprise that after Moody’s last month downgraded SoftBank’s debt, noting that a sale of assets right now would be challenging, SoftBank threw a tantrum and fired the credit ratings provider.Son’s lack of contrition to investors for the WeWork debacle indicates that his brash, impatient style can’t be unwound. That bold, fearless vision is at the core of his identity and the foundation of his success. He is who he is, and that’s unlikely to change.But investors in SoftBank and the Vision Fund can change. They just have to realize that Son’s impatience is not a virtue.Follow and connect with us on Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin\"}, {'headline': 'Coronavirus updates for April 14', 'url': 'http://yourstory.com/2020/04/coronavirus-updates-for-april-14', 'section': 'News', 'body': \"In an address to the nation on Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced an extension of the nationwide lockdown till May 3.

The crisis and the subsequent lockdown have dealt a body blow to most startups, many of whom have seen their turnover drastically hit in the past one month.A survey of 274 entrepreneurs and investors conducted by 100X.VC, an early-stage fund, concluded that rationalising ad spends and office expenses were on the top of the mind of entrepreneurs to reduce burn; 36% said they would opt for salary restructuring and 19% would resort to downsizing.“Startups which have been funded have already taken measures to contain costs, and many have deferred new expansion and hires. It is a sign of maturity we see within founders,” the report said. “Everybody realises that the bar for raising new rounds of investments have gone high.”A number of startups, including some well-capitalised ones, have either laid off employees or initiated pay cuts to absorb the loss of revenues. For instance OYO, Acko, Bounce, Vogo, Droom, Homelane, Meesho, and Travel Triangle, among others, have reportedly either laid off, put people on furlough, or implemented pay cuts.According to the survey, 66% of the founders polled are in the middle of a fundraising activity. Raising funds, evidently, has become difficult in such times, both in terms of availability as well as the time taken to close rounds. About 45% of the founders polled said the process of closing a round had slowed, while 10% said VCs aren’t responding at all.A clutch of venture capital firms recently came together to warn such startups, which have been aggressively investing in expansion, of an impending slowdown in funding and reorient their businesses accordingly.“Assumptions from bull-market financings or even from a few weeks ago do not apply…valuation multiples will be reset. This is because many investors perceive there is much more macro risk today and public markets are now valuing companies differently than a few weeks ago,” said a note jointly put out by Accel, SAIF Partners, Sequoia Capital India, Matrix Partners India, Nexus Venture Partners, Omidyar Network India, Chiratae Ventures, Kalaari Capital, Bessemer Venture Partners, and Lightspeed.According to the 100X.VC, about three-fourths of the investors polled said that entrepreneurs are asking for a lower valuation in line with market sentiments.“Investors will be wary of overpaying and will walk away from high valuation deals. Cash-rich investors will seek a bargain deal. The ₹30-crore valuation deal may be available for ₹15 crore-20 crore in three months, while the performance metrics continue to remain the same,” the report stated.A little more than half the founders polled said either they will decrease the size of fundraising or delay the process altogether. “It would be prudent for the founders to recalibrate their fundraising in line with market conditions. The best time to engage with investors is when there is light at the end of the tunnel,” the report says.\\n\\n'}, {'headline': \"From Oyo to WeWork, Son's growth at any cost strategy cost him $17 billion\", 'url': 'http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/from-oyo-to-wework-sons-growth-at-any-cost-strategy-cost-him-17-billion/articleshow/75133502.cms', 'section': 'Small Biz', 'body': 'By Tim Culpan  For a man with a 100-year vision, Masayoshi Son sure seems impatient.  We already know that the SoftBank Group Corp. chairman wasn’t content letting Adam Neumann be slightly crazy in his plan to upend the short-term office rental market; indeed he encouraged the founder of The We Co. to be even crazier.  And when a young Ritesh Agarwal was building out Oyo Hotels & Homes as a purveyor of standardized, quality accommodation in India, it was Son who told him to dream bigger: Challenge the world’s largest hoteliers, he urged. SoftBank’s Vision Fund initially put around $250 million into Oyo, and later led a further $1 billion funding round that pushed its valuation to $5 billion, Bloomberg News reported.   With Agarwal, the SoftBank founder even went a step further. He backed a $2 billion loan to let the 25-year old buy back shares in Oyo, driving the value to $10 billion — with the added effect of boosting the Vision Fund’s paper profits. Son probably preferred that the stake, bought from earlier backers, land in the hands of the Indian entrepreneur than a rival investor.   But now those huge bets are starting to unravel. SoftBank late Monday said it expects to record an investment loss of 1.8 trillion yen at the Vision Fund for the year ended March 31. That translates to about $16.6 billion, and takes a sizable chunk out of the $100 billion fund. The company will take a further 800 billion yen loss on investments outside the fund, including writedowns on WeWork and WorldVu Satellites Ltd., better known as OneWeb.  Oyo is just one victim of this SoftBank-fueled roller-coaster, which accelerated when the Covid-19 pandemic started to spread. The Indian startup has furloughed staff in a bid to save cash, and founder Agarwal’s shares could be in jeopardy if he faces margin calls.   Son’s insistence that startups grow faster than their founders planned, and strong-arm them into taking more money than they might have wanted, has turned into a burden. And that’s become a huge liability to investors in the Vision Fund and SoftBank, too.  By throwing cash around, dozens of startups became addicted to spending instead of building fiscal discipline into their business models. For years, it seemed like a sound strategy. By having more money than rivals, SoftBank-backed companies could win market share by offering bigger incentives, taking out more ads and luring the best talent.  Today, SoftBank has a major stake in sector leaders like Uber Technologies Inc., WeWork, Grab Holdings Inc. and Oyo. But climbing to number one doesn’t mean being profitable.  It’s easy to blame the venture capital model itself. The whole point of this founding pile of cash is to tide a business over until it finds a working model that’s sustainable. And in starting the Vision Fund with a $100 billion endowment, Son wanted to be the Godfather of venture capitalists.  But a good VC shouldn’t just be a loud cheerleader for its portfolio companies; it’s also the wise old voice of reason when founders’ success gets to their head. Savvy VCs can advise when to pivot, when to kill products and when to sell out to a rival.   Instead, the Vision Fund acts more like the loud soccer mom, intent on letting the world know that her kid is best on field and screaming at the coach when the child gets benched.  Just as Son has been the enabler of fiscally dubious business models, investors in SoftBank and the Vision Fund have been enablers of the founder’s recklessness. For over a decade, Son has been dining out on his winning bet on Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., with few detractors brave enough to poke a stick at the pile of debt he’s built up along the way to buy telcos and internet companies.  It’s perhaps no surprise that after Moody’s Corp. last month downgraded SoftBank’s debt, noting that a sale of assets right now would be challenging, SoftBank threw a tantrum and fired the credit ratings provider.  Son’s lack of contrition to investors for the WeWork debacle indicates that his brash, impatient style can’t be unwound. That bold, fearless vision is at the core of his identity and the foundation of his success. He is who he is, and that’s unlikely to change.  But investors in SoftBank and the Vision Fund can change. They just have to realize that Son’s impatience is not a virtue.

The Japanese company expects to record a 1.8 trillion yen loss from its Vision Fund and another 800 billion yen in losses from SoftBank’s own investments. It has written down the value of investments in companies, including office-rental startup WeWork and satellite operator OneWeb, which filed for bankruptcy last month. SoftBank’s shares fell as much as 4.2% to 4,025 yen in Tokyo on Tuesday.  Son’s conglomerate has taken one blow after another since the implosion of WeWork’s initial public offering last year and SoftBank’s subsequent bailout. It bet heavily on sharing-economy startups, which allow people to split the use of offices or cars, but those investments have been particularly hard hit as the coronavirus pandemic curbs unnecessary human interaction.  “This is looking more and more like the perfect storm for SoftBank,” said Justin Tang, head of Asian Research at United First Partners. “The question is whether there is more to come.”  The Vision Fund probably wrote down about 1 trillion yen in assets in the March quarter, based on its earlier earnings reports. SoftBank didn’t detail all the startups that took hits.  Investors have become increasingly spooked about the stability of Son’s empire and its $100 billion Vision Fund amid the virus outbreak. Shares tumbled at one point more than 50% from their peak this year, and SoftBank’s credit default swaps -- the cost of insuring debt against default -- spiked to their highest levels in about decade.  Son has also drawn unusual pressure from some investors. The U.S. activist investor Elliott Management Corp. took a substantial stake in the company, advocating for changes in governance and investing practices.  The billionaire responded with a strategy to part with some of his precious holdings, unloading about $41 billion in assets to buy back shares and pay off debts. SoftBank plans to sell about $14 billion of shares in Chinese e-commerce leader Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as part of an effort, Bloomberg News has reported.  “This will only make asset sales even more urgent for SoftBank,” said Koji Hirai, the head of M&A at advisory firm Kachitas Corp. in Tokyo.  It’s a dramatic turnaround for the 62-year-old Son. Just two months ago, he declared on stage in Tokyo that SoftBank’s fortunes were turning around after the WeWork meltdown.  “After a difficult winter always comes spring,” Son said at the time.  He highlighted a big surge in the shares of Uber Technologies Inc., one of SoftBank’s bigger holdings, explaining that his company would likely be able to book a profit on the stake. He also declared WeWork poised for a comeback.  But the coronavirus outbreak wreaked havoc on those plans. With fear of contagion, people stopped sharing offices from Beijing to New York. Ride-hailing companies -- SoftBank has stakes in four of the biggest worldwide -- saw business evaporate. Dara Khosrowshahi, chief executive officer of Uber, publicly declared “I wouldn’t put my kids in an Uber.”  Another sign of the troubles is Oyo, a hotel-booking service into which SoftBank invested about $1.5 billion. Its business model has been slammed as global travel screeched to a halt. This month, Ritesh Agarwal, founder and chief executive officer, said the company would furlough employees in countries outside India as it struggles to survive the virus.  Complicating the situation is that Agarwal, 26, borrowed about $2 billion to buy more shares in his own company. Son personally guaranteed the loans, Bloomberg News has reported.  SoftBank’s controversial accounting practices have aggravated the volatility of its earnings. The Vision Fund booked profits on startups as their valuations rose, even if the gains were only on paper and no shares were sold. WeWork and Oyo both contributed to profits early on in the fund’s lifetime.  Now the Vision Fund, which Son has declared is the future of his company, is piling up losses as valuations are written down again. The fund has lost a cumulative 240 billion yen since SoftBank began breaking out its results, including the most recent quarter forecast, according to Bloomberg calculations.  SoftBank’s operating loss for the current fiscal year is the most ever for the company, which Son took public in 1994. Its projected net loss of 750 billion yen would also be a record and compares with a 1.41 trillion yen profit the year earlier.  Sales for the fiscal year are expected to fall about 36% to 6.15 trillion yen after SoftBank removed U.S. unit Sprint Corp. from its balance sheet to account for its merger with T-Mobile US Inc.  “The coronavirus was the final blow, but bad investments and misjudgments were the start,” said Hirai of Kachitas.

According to the Wall Street Journal, that likely means its investments are worth less now than when it launched with $100 billion in funding in 2017.SoftBank was already having a tough time as coworking space company WeWork imploded following a failed initial public offering effort last year; SoftBank previously valued WeWork at a ridiculous $47 billion and was forced to bail it out in a deal that valued it at just $8 billion. WeWork is now in far deeper trouble, including a legal battle with SoftBank over a canceled $3 billion tender offer and the coronavirus pandemic, which has left it unable to pay rent at some locations. Uber’s IPO last year went badly, with the company continuing to hemorrhage cash and the  pandemic slamming it with heavy losses; the Journal wrote that the Vision Fund’s multi-billion dollar stake in it is down nearly 20 percent from the original price. Uber’s Chinese counterpart Didi Chuxing, which is also backed by the fund, is also doing poorly.According to Barron’s, other Vision Fund-backed companies that have taken blows in recent months include budget Indian hotel chain Oyo Rooms, offsite construction company Katerra, Latin American food delivery app Rappi, pizza-making robot company Zume, and Brazilian gym network Gympass. Other bad bets have included dog-walking firm Wag, e-commerce biz Brandless, and car-sharing company Getaround. Satellite internet startup OneWeb, which was backed by SoftBank but not part of the Vision Fund, filed for bankruptcy in February after the coronavirus’s impact on markets helped scuttle plans to raise $2 billion in new funding.Per to the Journal, Son has tried to prop up SoftBank’s plunging shares (down almost 30 percent in the last year) by agreeing to sell billions in assets to fund buying back up to\\xa0$18 billion in its stock and $23 billion of its debt. A SoftBank forecast released on Monday said the firm expects an expected operating loss of $12 billion and a net loss of $7 billion for the year that ended on March 31, the paper wrote. That is SoftBank’s first annual loss in 15 years, according to Reuters. Those numbers could change as SoftBank finalizes numbers but are unlikely to swing much more in its favor. PitchBook venture capital analyst Kyle Stanford told the New York Times that while many other investment firms were writing down the value of their portfolios, “no other firm can match the scale of SoftBank” right now. He added that the Vision Fund  “will have to choose its best investments to support” as the global economy enters what is anticipated to be a protracted, painful recovery from the pandemic.Under Son’s leadership, the Vision Fund pushed companies to aggressively expand and poured billions towards growth at all costs. That resulted in many of those firms burning through cash with no end in sight, as well as an extremely risky reliance on a handful of huge investments to stay afloat. As the Journal noted, Son quickly grew the fund with money from Saudi and Abu Dhabi, though that came with strings attached that leave the fund in a terrible position right now:Of the $100 billion committed to the fund, 40% came via preferred stock sold to the Saudis and Abu Dhabi, constituting a debtlike security that pays an annual interest rate of 7% and allows the holders to get their money back before other Vision Fund investors including SoftBank. That structure can juice positive returns, but also magnify losses.Meantime, the fund may not be able to backstop its cash-burning companies with follow-up investments because cash intended for that purpose might have to go toward paying interest to the preferred investors.The “only reason all of these gambles haven’t completely destroyed SoftBank,” TechCrunch wrote, is that it continues to rake in solid returns from e-commerce firm Alibaba—the success of which Son touted while luring investors to the Vision Fund—and its core holdings in telecoms and semiconductor companies. As of February, efforts by SoftBank to start a second, $108 billion fund were collapsing, with around half that money reportedly raised; prospects for that followup seem even dimmer now.'}, {'headline': 'Oyo executives accused of faking NOCs from Treebo-listed hotels', 'url': 'http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/hotels-/-restaurants/oyo-execs-accused-of-faking-nocs-from-treebo-listed-hotels/articleshow/75129400.cms', 'section': 'Industry', 'body': \"NEW DELHI: Executives at Oyo have submitted “invalid” no-objection certificates from about 70 hotels to online travel agency (OTA) Booking.com last week, to change the ownership listing of the properties to the SoftBank-backed chain from rival Treebo, people familiar with the matter, including several hotel owners, have alleged.  Brands like Oyo and Treebo list their properties on other platforms like Booking.com, besides their own apps and websites. OTAs have to be given NOCs from property owners to list any ownership changes.  Hotel owners ET spoke to said they received queries from Treebo on the matter. Treebo also shared Booking.com's clarifications subsequently with them, they said.  As per its email to Treebo, which ET has seen, Booking.com said after making necessary checks it had identified that the NOCs provided by Oyo on these properties were “invalid”. In its email, Booking.com also stated it had escalated the matter to Oyo's leadership team.  Most of the properties on the list were formerly with Oyo.  Oyo didn’t respond to an email from ET seeking comment till press time Monday.   75132275 Booking.com did not specifically respond to ET’s queries, but said it required its accommodation partners to abide by all the applicable laws and compliances.  There is a standard process that we follow at Booking.com for listing properties and the same process is being followed right now as well,  the Amsterdam-headquartered company stated.  A Treebo spokesperson did not name Oyo but said one of its competitors had used fake documents recently to try to wrongfully take control of the OTA listings of several of its partner properties.  As a standard procedure in case of all such takeovers, Booking.com intimated us. When we checked with our partners, all of them vehemently denied providing any such documents or agreeing to join this competitor,” the spokesperson said. “So, this was clearly a fraud act directed at taking advantage of the relative inactivity of hotel owners due to Covid-19.   Vivek Soni, who owns hotel One Lovelock in Kolkata, said he had not given any NOC to Oyo, but his property was on the list the company had given to Booking.com. “The NOC is fake. I was previously with Oyo and they owe me over Rs 12 lakh. The agreement with Oyo was for 14% commission and they went on to deduct 29% without informing me,” he said. “When Oyo did not settle my accounts, I moved to Treebo.”    \"}, {'headline': 'OYO Loses Up To 60 Percent of Its Revenue Due To Coronavirus Crisis', 'url': 'http://latestly.com/technology/oyo-loses-up-to-60-percent-of-its-revenue-due-to-coronavirus-crisis-1680706.html', 'section': 'Technology', 'body': \"New Delhi: Global hospitality chain OYO which is currently losing up to 60 per cent of its revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic, is apparently turning out to be another fiasco in the making for Japanese conglomerate SoftBank Group after the co-working space company WeWork.

He’ll typically stay a few days, catching up in-person with his U.S.-based colleagues at his venture capital firm, Lightspeed Venture Partners, or rubbing shoulders with another frequent visitor, China-based colleague James Mi. “I’m there because I want to be,” says Somaia. “I think it’s really essential, because otherwise you end up very siloed.”\\nToday, Somaia gets that facetime the same way he shares it with Forbes in late March: virtually, over Zoom. Like other venture capital firms, Lightspeed’s in-person meetings have been put on hold as COVID-19 spreads across the globe. For Lightspeed, which has nine offices globally and a rapidly expanding team, it’s an especially painful – but necessary – move. In February, after an employee visited Lightspeed’s Menlo Park, California offices and later tested positive, the firm wrote to anyone who had been in the building over the following few days to warn them that they might have been exposed.\\nWith startups struggling to justify high valuations and others facing tough decisions to lay off or furlough employees, the tech investing ecosystem looks dramatically different in just a matter of weeks. For new fund managers, it’s a barren moment: according to an April report from PitchBook and the National Venture Capital Association, just nine new funds were raised in the first three months of 2020 – compared to more than 49 over the same period in each of the previous three years.\\n\\nBut it’s still a good time to be a mega-fund, and Lightspeed is the latest to benefit. The firm announced on Tuesday that it had closed on $4.2 billion in new capital across three funds. Those include $890 million for its latest early-stage venture fund, a $1.83 billion growth fund for later-stage investments, and a $1.5 billion opportunity fund for doubling down on winners in its international portfolio.\\nLightspeed believes it has past results and the current portfolio to not just survive the coronavirus’ chilling effect on the startup ecosystem, but to thrive afterward. But on its 20th anniversary, Lightspeed’s partners still find themselves at a crossroads of what legacy they’re building, and what Lightspeed wants to be. Its fresh billions will give it more time to find out.\\n\\n“We can’t afford to not be where there are going to be great ideas and great people,” says Ravi Mhatre, No. 27 on the Midas List for 2020. “When you have more scale, when you have the kind of richness and the variety of ideas if you have the right talent in the building, you just have an unfair advantage.”\\n\\n\\n\\nRavi Mhatre, seen here at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2017, was one of Lightspeed's founders who brought ... [+] it early enterprise software chops.\\n\\nSteve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch\\n\\n\\nLightspeed got its start in 2000 when six investors from a then 30-year-old firm called Weiss Peck & Greer decided they wanted to split off in the wake of the dotcom bubble bust. Some firms had closed up shop; others were looking to play it safe, investing in established businesses that were already well-funded and had meaningful sales figures to point to. Receiving permission from Cisco to take back the name for a startup they’d previously sold to the tech giant, they set up shop as Lightspeed with a $1 billion fund for early stage investments. \\nFor the next decade, Lightspeed remained an enterprise software and infrastructure specialist. The firm built a reputation through investments like flash storage business Nimble Storage (IPO 2013), infrastructure company Nutanix (IPO 2016), MuleSoft (IPO 2017) and AppDynamics (acquired by Cisco in 2017), all billion-dollar-plus exits. But a decade into its existence, before those companies had gone public, Lightspeed was better known among IT circles than it was among aspiring entrepreneurs. That changed with Snapchat, a career-making win for Midas List No. 34 Jeremy Liew, that established Lightspeed as a consumer startup force. \\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Snap went public on March 02, 2017, Lightspeed held a stake valued at just under $2 billion.\\n\\nGetty Images\\n\\n\\nA veteran of Netscape, AOL and Barry Diller’s IAC, Liew had joined Lightspeed in 2006 as its first consumer tech-focused partner but had yet to fully make his mark. Much like James Mi, No. 21 on the Midas List, in China, or Somaia in India, Lightspeed waited for Liew to build a foothold, even across several funds of relative under-performance. With so many companies starting globally and in new categories like social media, Lightspeed felt it couldn’t afford to miss out. “Ride the wave, don’t try to pick a surfboard,” says cofounder Barry Eggers of their mindset. “And put as many surfboards on it as you can.”\\nThe patience paid off in what has become Silicon Valley lore: Eggers’ teenaged daughter came across Snapchat at school and showed Eggers, who alerted Liew Snapchat’s Evan Spiegel, still a student at Stanford, relented to a meeting in part because Liew’s Facebook profile photo pictured him with President Barack Obama. When Snapchat went public in 2017, Lightspeed owned a stake valued just under $2 billion at its IPO price. \\n\\n\\n\\nLightspeed partner Jeremy Liew won big with Snap; he's now a mentor to the firm's consumer practice.\\n\\nGetty\\n\\n\\nToday, many of Lightspeed’s best-known portfolio companies are from its consumer practice: celebrity messaging app Cameo and meditation app Calm, Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop media and retail business, Jessica Alba’s The Honest Company, Rothy’s shoes and wedding registry Zola. Liew has turned mentor, meanwhile, to a growing group of partners like Nicole Quinn, a member of the Midas Brink List of up and coming investors in 2020, and who says Rothy’s was an example of a company they wooed – and work with – as a team. \\nLiew, Quinn and the newer generation of investors at Lightspeed – many, but not all consumer-focused – are younger, brasher, more adept at social media than some of the firm’s veterans, who express discomfort talking to press but are happy to meld styles. “Organizations reflect the style of the people in them,” says Mhatre. “I think we have succeeded without over-rotating on brand.”\\nBy its returns, Lightspeed appears to be one of Silicon Valley’s standouts: 19 of its 21 IPOs have happened in the last decade, and its 2012 fund currently stands at a net return of 3.6x, with 1.7x already distributed to limited partners. Lightspeed says it’s returned $1.5 billion each year for the past three years. \\nBut there have been plenty of controversies in recent years, in part due to Lightspeed’s propensity to back ambitious startups that can then face their own scrutiny, from Goop’s relationship with science to an enterprise software founder feud, the rise and fall of HQ Trivia, and Oyo, the hotel business backed by SoftBank whose CEO sparked a flurry of headlines by buying $2 billion in shares of his own business at a $10 billion valuation with SoftBank’s help, then found itself exposed in the wake of the coronavirus and reportedly froze operations while furloughing thousands of staff.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen the #MeToo movement swept across Silicon Valley, a former Lightspeed investor, Justin Caldbeck, was accused of unwanted sexual advances in June 2017. Days later, as reporters revealed that Stitch Fix founder Katrina Lake had complained to Lightspeed about Caldbeck’s behavior years before that alleged misconduct, and that Lightspeed had asked Lake to sign a non-disparagement agreement afterward, Lightspeed issued a statement on Twitter that it “should have done more.” \\nWhether Lightspeed acted any differently from another large VC firm would have, it was a bad look for a firm already grappling with its own external image, and which spent at least part of 2017 participating in a glitzy, highly-edited and now forgotten Shark Tank knock-off that Apple produced in 2017 featuring Liew, Quinn and several other Lightspeed partners, alongside Paltrow, Alba, performer Will.i.am and entrepreneur and media personality Gary Vaynerchuk. \\n\\n\\n\\nNicole Quinn, seen here at TechCrunch Disrupt in 2019, is a member of a second generation of ... [+] investors at Lightspeed.\\n\\nSteve Jennings/Getty Images for TechCrunch\\n\\n\\nLightspeed “did a little introspection as a firm,” says Eggers, around that time, and realized “we’re not really that diverse.”\\xa0\\xa0Eggers now proudly points to Lightspeed’s nine female investment partners as proof that “you either dwell on those things or you use them as an impetus to get better.” \\nFormer Netflix and Twitter executive Jana Messerschmidt was one of a batch of new partners that joined in December 2018. She says she sees parallels between those high-growth businesses and the wave of expansion at Lightspeed: “It’s a very dynamic, fast and fast-changing environment.” \\nBut because Lightspeed, like some other firms, calls all 35 members of its global investment team “partners,” whether they can write checks or not, how much the firm has taken such diversity seriously by promoting women to senior leadership roles is less than clear. \\nIn March 2019, cofounder and Midas alum Chris Schaepe left the firm after making known his connection to an individual at the center a wide-ranging college admissions scandal; Schaepe, who has not been charged, has said he didn’t knowingly participate in any wrongdoing. Remaining partners at Lightspeed say the firm’s misrepresented in VC backchannels. “People say Lightspeed is a sharp-elbowed place, that it’s really competitive, competitive internally. That you don’t want to go there. And it could not be further from the truth,” says Quinn.\\nLast October, Lightspeed brought in a Lyft executive, David Baga, to oversee the firm’s global operations. Baga says he was aware of cultural “challenges” when deciding to join the firm as its first chief operating officer. “I took a lot from the swiftness of the team’s response,” says Baga. “I believe that has been transformative in what this firm aspires to be in the community that we serve. So to me it was actually a reason to join.”\\nLightspeed raised its new funds mostly before the spread of COVID-19. With a limited partner base that includes one-third from U.S. public pensions including the Illinois Municipal Retirement Fund, the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System and the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, according to data from startup tracker PitchBook, as well as 11% from non-profits, foundations and endowments, their success has a broader impact than simply elevating Lightspeed’s good name.\\n\\n\\n\\nLightspeed portfolio business Oyo, whose CEO Ritesh Agarwal is seen here at a SoftBank event in ... [+] 2019, have been hit hard by the coronavirus. But Lightspeed quietly cashed out much of its last year, to the tune of $750 million.\\n\\n© 2019 Bloomberg Finance LP\\n\\n\\nThat also means the pressure is on Lightspeed to continue to deliver top quartile returns, even as it’s pushed into growth investing through companies like equity management platform Carta, and as businesses like travel management firm TripActions and Oyo find themselves without a market, at least temporarily, as the virus keeps people at home. With bigger funds comes the need to produce correspondingly bigger returns. \\nLightspeed sees its global presence as an asset in such turbulent times. Its U.S. investors and businesses have been learning from their Chinese counterparts in recent weeks about how how to weather the storm of COVID-19 and how to position themselves for when businesses reopen; those lessons can then be exported to India, behind the U.S. in its spread of the virus and civic shutdown, and so on, says partner Arif Janmohamed. Lightspeed’s $1.5 billion opportunity fund, meanwhile, intended to act as an international bridge pooling the financial success of its different semi-independent local venture funds, meanwhile, could be deployed in part to keep portfolio businesses afloat at discount prices. And even at Lightspeed’s most high-profile business adrift in the current crisis, Oyo, the firm may make out just fine. Lightspeed sold more than $750 million worth of Oyo shares in 2019, according to a person with knowledge of the sale, meaning that whatever happens, the firm is already firmly in the black.\\nSo as Lightspeed looks ahead to a future emerging from the coronavirus, its leadership is hopeful that it will have put its generational transition, cultural growing pains and short-term valuation heartburn in rear view. Says Somaia from India – still a board member at Oyo, even after Lightspeed’s partial sale: “Having been through a couple of these, you know, the reality is that if you’re in business with extremely talented founders, going after very large markets with very unique propositions, usually things work out.”Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus\\n\"}, {'headline': 'ByteDance launches global hiring spree in middle of coronavirus Tumult', 'url': 'http://hindustantimes.com/education/bytedance-launches-global-hiring-spree-in-middle-of-virus-tumult/story-23gbtxeveulh9byhzhgdpm.html', 'section': 'education', 'body': 'ByteDance Inc. just kicked off a wave of hiring it envisions hitting 40,000 new jobs in 2020, hoping to match Alibaba’s payroll at a time technology corporations across the globe are furloughing or reducing staff.The world’s largest startup is recruiting people for 10,000 open positions, of which about a third are high-level research or software coding jobs, according to an internal website provided to staff for referrals and shared with Bloomberg. Representatives with ByteDance didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.New hires around the globe will support its universe of apps from video platform TikTok to news aggregator Toutiao, while strengthening its operations in new arenas such as e-commerce and gaming. It’s the first salvo of ByteDance’s goal to reach 100,000 staff globally by the end of the year, outlined by Chief Executive Officer Zhang Yiming in an internal memo last month. Once complete, the company will boast roughly the same number of employees as tech giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.ByteDance is seeking to consolidate its social media strongholds in China and the U.S. while spurring expansions in new markets. Its hiring spree contrasts with other startups, including SoftBank-backed Oyo Hotels & Homes, Zume Pizza Inc. and Brandless Inc., that have been cutting jobs or shutting down altogether.Like rival Tencent Holdings Ltd, ByteDance’s social media channels have seen usage spike after the Covid-19 pandemic confined millions of people to their homes.

The Chinese app factory is also orchestrating forays into gaming, live-streaming commerce and even enterprise software, taking on deeper-pocketed rivals like Tencent and Alibaba.Overall, ByteDance is hiring some 3,000 coding, engineering and research staff, and about as many people for products and operations, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Beyond China, it’s looking to boost headcount by adding more than 100 posts per location in London, Los Angeles, Mountain View and Singapore.ByteDance, last valued at $75 billion according to CB Insights, is one of China’s most ambitious tech outfits.

airlines end up laying off workers. Delta Airlines said it would cut flights and freeze hiring. American Airlines is also cutting flights, and delaying trainings for new flight attendants and pilots. \\nWhat we don’t know: Exactly how many restaurant workers have been laid off due to the pandemic. New York City, a dining mecca, has about 27,000 eating and drinking establishments that were staffed by over 300,000 people. Restaurants are able to fulfill delivery and takeout orders, but can do so using skeleton crews.\\nBig number: 50%. That’s how many U.S. companies are considering layoffs, according to a survey released by Challenger, Gray & Christmas, the country’s oldest outplacement firm. And the Federal Reserve of St. Louis estimated that 47 million jobs could be lost due to the coronavirus crisis. The numbers come on the heels of the 10 million American workers who\\xa0filed for unemployment, according to data released Thursday, an all-time high. \\nKey background: There are now over 350,000 reported coronavirus cases in the U.S. and over nearly 10,000 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide cases now amount to over 1.3 million infected and nearly 74,000 dead. Meanwhile, President Trump signed a coronavirus relief bill into law that provides free testing and paid sick leave, along with a $2 trillion stimulus package. New York and other state and city governments have declared states of emergency, banned large gatherings and ordered the closings of restaurants and bars to stem the spread of disease. Cancelations of concerts, sports leagues, festivals, religious gatherings and other large events have impacted millions of people. President Trump enacted a 30 day travel ban from Europe that sent airlines and travelers scrambling to adjust, before declaring a national state of emergency March 13. The uncertainty over when the country—and its citizens—can resume normal life is a specter hanging over businesses, as they decide whether to cut workers.\\nFurther reading: \\nTracker: Media Layoffs, Furloughs And Pay Cuts Due To Coronavirus (Noah Kirsch)Full coverage and live updates on the Coronavirus\\n\"}]}}\n"

to face a severe impact due to lack of demand and capital demand for industrial logistics and warehousing construction and data centres is likely to lead to a strong recovery in future if global manufacturing giants shift some capacity from china to india aided by favourable government policies it could lead to some construction demand in the manufacturing sector longterm outlook for the

of life to indian medical device manufacturers who are mostly in the msme sector many of these big companies that have partnered with medical device makers are going to stay back as partners as there

public pressure to invest more in health infrastructure especially primary and secondary care a motilal oswal research report says the indian governments health expenditure as percentage to gdp has remained at  per cent whereas the world average is  per cent similarly india has one of the least number of doctors per  population india had over decades ignored fundamentals like strengthening primary healthcare producing adequate doctors and setting up public sector hospitals and related infrastructure says muralidharan nair a public health expert and partner and leader health at ey india the old system of primary care and secondary care is broken and needs to be restored says rb smarta chairman and managing director interlink which advises life science companiesindia also has an opportunity in the biotechnology sector say experts but lack of biotech infrastructure is a big issue for example serum has been able to develop a vaccine candidate for coronavirus but is not sure if it can make that in india this vaccine candidate will have to be handled under bsl  biosafety level conditions which is basically a very high containment level and i dont know how many facilities in the world have high volume manufacturing in bsl  even if you have the vaccine the main challenge will be to manufacture it in large volumes says adar poonawala ceo serum institute of indiaindia will also have to develop a scientific community that can market its ips encourage entrepreneurscientists and create infrastructure to make india a power house in the biomedical sector kiran majumdar shah founder and chairperson biocon has written in a blogmuralidharan nair says the indian pharma industry should focus on developing new molecules rather than using chemistry skills to make copycat

      " when prime minister narendra modi removed his mask while speak during his televised address to the nation on april  the business world was gasping india had been under a nationwide lockdown for  days to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus and that had kept economic activity across the country on hold like all other industries the tech startup sector had been hoping for the curbs to be lifted appbased commerce businesses — from cabs to general ecommerce — had been nonoperational for nearly a month  pm modi however kept the lockdown in place extending it till may  but he suggested all ecommerce services might be allowed from april  as part of relaxations for some sectors and then came the rude shock just a day before ecommerce was supposed to open the government made a uturn and said the status quo should be maintained  this backandforth by the government and the uncertainty of the whole situation – a novel virus that has no cure – has been a massive curveball for startups and the impact is still unfolding  impact on the tech world  the impact has been disparate across the technology world online travel platforms hotel aggregators flight booking sites cabbooking apps and real estaterelated services have been shut since march  they have had zero sales and this scenario is unlikely to change for several months  on the other hand digital services — from social media to online video streaming elearning news digital payments and ehealth — are all seeing a boom but this surge might not be sustainable say experts as people would pull back on their discretionary spending in the near future  the impact is also disparate across segments of ecommerce india’s biggest startup subsector where sale of groceries and foodrelated essentials are permitted during the lockdown everything else including electronics and mobiles which account of for  per cent of these companies’ yearly revenues have been shut  a study in contrast are fooddelivery apps which have stayed afloat by convincing the authorities that folks need their favourite cuisine delivered to their homes during lockdown however as most restaurants stay shut their services are also limited   also read this smallcap company has found its watershed moment in covid pandemic   costcutting  retrenchment and salary cuts have hit startups hard the most impacted are the ones related to airlines and hotel industries ixigio uslisted makemytrip goibibo and redbus have all announced salary cuts fabhotels has laid off  per cent of its workforce and oyo has asked thousands of its employees mostly those in china and the us to go on leave without pay  the socalled unicorns – startups valued at over  billion – are also spooked as most of them tread on marginal runways with monthly sales barely funding outsized operations but it is the little guys earlystage startups that are the ones facing an existential crisis all new funding discussions have stalled and funds are doubling down to support their existing portfolios  “after a good start to  for pevc investments both investment and exit activities declined considerably in february ” says vivek soni partner and national leader private equity services ey investments in february declined  per cent from the previous month and could slump even more  calls to save the digital and startup ecosystem have gained steam on april  a collective of two dozen startup founders and top vcs — from mohit bhatnagar of sequoia to paytm’s vijay shekhar sharma — wrote to the government for a “robust relief package” the wish list included paying salaries for only  per cent of the workforce interestfree loans waiver of office rent and tax benefits  the government has also acted to prevent hostile takeover by foreign investors it changed foreign direct investment fdi rules on april  which now mandates that all deal proposals from entities in countries sharing borders with india — china pakistan bangladesh etc — have to be approved by the government  the idea is to prevent hostile and opportunistic takeovers especially by chinese entities which have high interests in indian firms experts say  pivots and partnerships  since the novel coronavirus was first discovered in china in late december infections from across the globe have nearly reached the  million mark and fatalities stand at  while analysts are at a loss to estimate the business impact the broad consensus is that it will be a protracted recovery over  months and some sectors will face a more significant churn than others  “pivot is the new name of the game for all startups somewhere it is a complete pivot and somewhere partial” says sanjay mehta of xvc a newlyfounded earlystage venture capital firm  at least five unrelated players that ordinarily deal in other products have started selling groceries listed as an essential service by the government on their platforms these are zomato in partnership with grofers meesho via ninjakart paytm mall via dealshare perpule via vishal megamart and nobroker via bigbasket  a recent media report suggested grofers and zomato they have sequoia as a common investor might be exploring a merger but the discussions would move slowly given the extraordinary times  meanwhile since schools and universities are shut edutech companies are having a field day byju’s the country’s largest online education startup valued at  billion is offering its products for free others like facebookbacked unacademy and toppr have followed suit by putting out free subscription  reorganisation  the lockdown has forced startups to move quickly grofers the leading grocery firm opened a new warehouse in gurgaon in two weeks and hired hundreds of new workers “we figured that if we could not have more people in the same warehouse — because of socialdistancing norms — we should open a new facility” explains founder and ceo albinder dhindsa  grofers’ services closed for  days during the early days of the lockdown were reopened gradually “now we are operating at  per cent of our precovid capacity but the demand is too high we are able to open ordering slots only for  minutes in a day” says dhindsa  others meanwhile are transitioning to take whatever benefit they can from a sharp uptick in digital consumption for instance curefit which operates over  gyms across the country is streaming online workout sessions  cofounder and ceo ankit nagori says these online workout sessions are attended by  people daily and the number is growing by  per cent each day curefit has also added telemedicine and plans to launch psychological care sessions and a covid testing solution in partnership with testing centres  digital services thrive  for digitalonly services — those like facebook instagram sharechat netflix gaana mx player and tiktok — the lockdown has had a positive impact  “over the past three weeks our platform has witnessed a x increase in time spent across genres” says karan bedi ceo of mx player an overthetop ott platform owing to the surge netflix stock in the us hit a week high recently  not only is traffic higher but platforms are also adding new users – even those who earlier were not on social media or watched otts “there is an expansion in demographics” says jehil thakkar partner media  entertainment deloitte india “in that sense it is a plus for digital entertainment and social media platforms but it remains to be seen whether this is only a momentary blip or will continue this way”  “consumption is up but monetisation is a question” adds thakkar  for platforms linked to tangible services the situation is grim ola and uber have completely ceased passenger cab operations their gimmickry of positioning themselves as services for health practitioners during this crisis has not yielded results uber’s tieup with grocery chains for delivery is currently the only area where it is operational albeit in a limited manner  they fear that thousands of cab drivers who have financed cars through them will be unable to pay back this might become a badloan crisis for banks ola said in a letter to the government on march   what lies ahead  estimates for how the indian economy will fare given how things stand today are now beginning to come british bank barclays estimated a billion economic loss for india and forecast nil gross domestic product gdp growth this calendar year the world bank lowered its forecast on india’s gdp growth to between  per cent and  per cent during fy from  per cent earlier  sequoia a storied venture capital firm has told founders to conserve as much cash as possible “focus on quality of revenue margins etc as opposed to growth at all costs through discounts it is okay to reduce growth rates survive at all costs and focus on getting to  months of cash runway” sequoia india’s bhatnagar said in a video session for founders arranged by tie  even if the lockdown is lifted on may  experts do not see most players recouping their losses during this period ecommerce firms may get users to shop more with special sales events planned in mayjune but people won’t check into hotels more or take more uber rides just because the lockdown is lifted explains gaurav rastogi ceo of mutual funds platform kuvera  “if this becomes a deep recession all nonessential services will be at risk” rastogi says even as he predicts a “savings bonanza” people are saving more money with a curtailed expenditure these extra savings by people who have their jobs — this is a majority group — could cause a demand uptick once the lockdown eases “people might want to upgrade their smartphones or buy a new car some part of that extra private savings would come into investments — fixed deposits or equities”  “another consequence of the lockdown will be a shortage of some food items says vasu chinnathambi cofounder of india’s largest grocery supply chain startup ninjakart “a challenge on the sourcing side will be the availability of vegetables in a month or two months from now a lot of farmers are not harvesting or sowing new crops this means there will be less availability in two months’ time and prices will go up” \n",

      "there is nothing about ritesh agarwal that lets one on about his status as the founder and ceo of india’s secondmost valuable startup  oyo hotels  homes not his scruffy beard not his dark jeans and jumper fortune india had met him on march  at oyo’s gurugram headquarters a week before india’s prime minister narendra modi announced a day national lockdown to contain the spread of the covid pandemicthe last few months have been tough on the hotel aggregator and its yearold founder in january the company went through a round of restructuring letting go of almost  of its workforce in india and now the spread of the coronavirus and the subsequent lockdowns in countries around the globe threaten to wipe out a large chunk of its revenue earlier this month the company announced it has seen a  fall in revenue and is putting its employees in the us on furloughsthe company has also been facing troubles with hotel partners and fighting a negative impact on the oyo brand its valuation and future expansion plans in an interview with fortune india agarwal explains that the company is trying to make things right edited excerptseveryone has been saying that oyo has grown too big too fast do you believe itdid we grow quick maybe we did but only after executing i could know what is the right pace of growth we learnt it from  and now we are on the path of making sure that we temper itwhen i started the business my aspiration was to set up  hotels in my lifetime you don’t start a company by anticipating or planning you learn improve and move on i learnt a lot from my management they are people who are way more educated experienced accomplished and intelligent than i am my job is to make sure that i set the longterm aspiration and bring in the best leaders to do their job i love learning new things and executing themwhat is the kind of support you have from your investors right now will you be raising any funds in the near futureour shareholders’ view has been very straightforward there is a business plan that the board has set up and the management just focussed on delivering that don’t get distracted by various things happening outside learn as much as you can but focus on delivering results we have no plans right now to raise funds we have a sizeable balance sheet so the focus now is on delivering resultsour key investors now are softbank lightspeed venture partners sequoia capital and airbnb smaller shareholders would be didi chuxing grab and sunil kant munjal of hero enterpriseyou had a round of restructuring early this year what were the reasons for thatthere were things last year that we did not do well…anybody who has seen oyo operate over the years will know that this company is of the kind which will acknowledge the problem and fix it acknowledging learnings and making decisions are symbols of good companies we made some restructuring across the board wherever we had duplication of workforce we wanted to address thatas we grew into  countries we hired for the same job in many countries because in early days you needed people for those roles but later technology replaced those jobs in many markets as a part of our restructuring exercise we had to let go people which is very disappointing however we did everything we could for our employees who we had to let go we gave them extra severance between three months and eight months depending on the roles many said we did this for capital management if so then we would not have spent so much capital it was just the right thing for the business to do at that pointyou also had trouble with dissatisfied hotel owners who have complained about payment delays and other issues how are you fixing thosethe hotel partners would complain that our sales staff are not aware of our accounting statement our business development executives were trained to sell solve problems but not fully trained to be an accounts person to solve that problem we trained our officers now any of our executives can talk about every detailing of sale price cost price cost of operating marginal cost of operating real estate cost real estate yield returns besides this we conducted training for many of our staff across different departments such as code of conduct softskill and behavioural trainingyou have also launched partner support programmes tell us about thatearlier our partner support was fieldoriented people in the cities would talk to people on the phone now we don’t need that anymore earlier the average turnaround time to solve an issue was seven hours but now the average turnaround time is  minutes because it is centralised by means of chat bots or support staff today  of our partner support queries in the us is now through chat bots the rest is still done by people on phone callswhen you enter a new market or choose a location no matter how much of data analytics you use you will still get  markets wrong we got certain markets wrong when we chose a location in the past so we decided not to do any growth investments in those  markets and invest in other citiesnext we looked at governance in november the company announced the appointment of betsy atkins ceo and founder of baja corporation as an independent director on oyo’s board atkins joined as the independent chair of the board we plan to make disproportionate investments towards building strong corporate governance right from the board to the management to big decisions of the companyin the last three months we have invested in growing up stronger as a healthy childtalk to us about the futurein the mediumterm you will see oyo grow stronger and every growth that oyo brings will lead to incremental bottom line improvements in india we will continue to back some of the newer businesses that we had launched but our global focus will become hotels and vacation homes in india we have much more strength to be able to back all other businesses for example the wedding business it is surprising that the wedding vertical does annually over ₹ crore of salesa detailed story on oyo and more on ritesh agarwal’s plans with the company at a time of crisis will be published in our may issue\n",

      "as the travel and hospitality industry goes through a nearstandstill scenario amid the coronavirus crisis hospitality major oyo last week announced furloughs or temporary leaves of  days for its employees in the us and select other markets while keeping its staff in india untouched from the move\n",
      "“a significant number of ‘oyopreneurs’ across the world are being placed on temporary leaves or furloughs of a minimum of  to  days and the details of these will be made available from hr teams of your respective countries” said oyo founder ritesh agarwal\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "according to financial times almost half of oyo is owned by softbank led by masayoshi son \n",
      "the chain was valued at  billion in its most recent fundraising and agarwal owns  per cent stake\n",
      "“but even before the pandemic caused ructions in oyo’s major markets analysts were questioning that valuation figure which is at the heart of the debate about whether oyo is another wework — an absurdly overvalued startup” said the report\n",
      "wework last week said that it has filed a lawsuit against softbank group corp after the latter withdrew its  billion tender offer for additional wework shares as agreed last year\n",
      "in a statement the we company the parent company of wework said that softbank has breached its obligations under the master transaction agreement mta by failing to complete the tender offer contemplated by it\n",
      "japanbased softbank last october announced the infusion of  billion into the struggling cosharing workspace company it had said that it would provide up to  billion for the existing shareholders of wework\n",
      "agarwal told financial times that it was wework that changed the atmosphere\n",
      "“there was before wework and then there was after weworkpre wework all our decisions were iconic later it seemed easy to blame us for all we decided” he was quoted as saying\n",
      "agarwal’s  per cent stake in oyo gives him a net worth of more than  billion which he may need to sell if situation does not improves\n",
      "the revenues of oyo and the occupancies have dropped by over  per cent the ceo however said that the global leading hotel chains have all dropped their revenues by over  per cent and continue to get worse\n",
      "the company said that it is also hopeful that as the situation begins to improve globally they will be able to bring as many of its employees as possible back to fulltime work at oyo\n",
      "highlighting some recent positive instances agarwal told his employees that there has been small recovery in some markets like china denmark and japan\n",
      "the softbank vision fund has taken a severe hit after the wework fiasco is oyo the next one\n",
